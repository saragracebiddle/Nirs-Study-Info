   annote = 		{This research utilized the Portamon device to measure tissue oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius in 13 male and 13 female participants using repeated, transient arterial occlusions after a brief exercise stimulus (knee extension or plantar flexion for VL and GC respectively). The NIRS measurements were taken twice, on separate days, for repeatability measurements. Participants also completed a step-incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer to exhaustion to determine FAT_{max} and LT, and a ramp incrememental test on a cycle ergometer to detemine VO_{2max}, GET, and RCP. All gas exchange measures were normalized by LBM (lean body mass). Adipose tissue over the NIRS measurement site was measured via ultrasound. NIRS data were corrected for blood volume changes. TSI was not reported as the researchers used HHb for measures of muscle oxygenation kinetics, since HHb is independed of exercise intensity (according to [@ryan2013]). Female participants were an average of 24.7 \pm 3.6 years old with adipose tissue thickness over the VL an average of 0.73 \pm 0.22 cm. These participants had an average body mass of 58.7 \pm 7.2 kg with lean body mass of 44.1 \pm 5.2 kg, and VO_{2max} normalized for LBM of 54.9 \pm 4.5 mL/kg LBM/min. NIRS derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for females in the vastus lateralis was 20.7 \pm 4.4 seconds. Day-to-day reliability measures found a CV of 8.7\% and ICC of 0.793 for female vastus lateralis tau measurements.

The NIRS probe (INVOS 5100C) was place on the ninth right rib in the midaxillary line and a second NIRS was used to monitor cerebral oxygenation. Two blood samples were drawn from the heaptic vein and compared with the simultaneous measurement by NIRS. The directly measured hepatic vein saturation was not correlated with the NIRS measured saturation. This may be due to the fact that hepatic blood flow is not well understood and some areas of the liver may receive no portal venous input. Also, ultrasound was not used to measure the depth of the liver from the skin surface. Since the probe was placed directly over the rib, the bone may have affected the measurement of liver blood flow. The researchers may have benefitted from using the HomER algorithm to correct for bone. Also, the paper does not well elucidate which NIRS signal they use when they refer to rSO_2-H. The researchers chose a line graph with dual lines for portal vein saturation and NIRS measured saturation when a scatterplot demonstrating a lack of correlation would have been more appropriate. The researchers may have benefitted from using an ultrasound to determine the depth of the liver with respect to the NIRS probe in order to determine whether the signal truly reached the depth of the liver tissue.

The NIRS probe (NIRO-300) was places overlying the palpable liver and directly below the right costal arch, with an inter-optode distance of 40 mm and shielded from ambient light. The NIRO-300 uses SRS principles with 4 laser diodes to obtain absolute measures for TOI. NIRS were taken at a sample rate of 2 seconds for 15 minutes, at which time blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter and SvO_2 was measured oximetrically. TOI and SvO_2 were positively correlated (r = 0.72) with the strongest correlation between TOI and SvO_2 when the catherter tip was located in the right atrium and without intra-cardia left-to-right shunt or sepsis (n=23, r = 0.88). Multivariate regression revealed SvO_2 explained up to 51\% of the observed variance in TOI, with the addition of variables age, hemoglobin concentration, SaO_2, FOE,Ca-vO_2, VCV tip position, positive pressure ventilation, sepsis, and intra-cardiac shunts only increasing the proportion of explained variance to 52.4\%. TOI and SvO_2 are good mutual predictors however they appear to be independent variables.
