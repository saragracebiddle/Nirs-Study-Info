# Website

This web page is created using the R package [bookdown]. This package breaks a website down into several components and knits them together before displaying a whole page. The components are R Markdown documents, which allows for embedding R code into the document before displaying the contents using HTML. 

Each chapter of the page is a separate R Markdown document.
