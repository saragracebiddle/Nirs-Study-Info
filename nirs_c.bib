Stability in Portamon measurements is reached approximately one hour after being turned on. Furter evaluation shows that a quite accurate estimation of the stable values is reached after 10 minutes. At this point, TSI reaches a value less than two percent lower than the stable value and THC reaches a value less than one percent higher than the stable value.

    The effect of adipose tissue varies by muscle/placement site. To use linear regression of total Hb+Mb to correct for adipose tissue thickness, the following assumptions must be used: 1) total Hb+Mb is composed of muscle Mb and capillary Hb. 2) across subjects there is a common `true` value for resting total Hb+Mb. 3) Skin capillary density or thickness, sex, and training status have no effect 4) The relationship between adipose tissue thickness and total Hb+Mb is linear at all possible adipose tissue thicknesses. Myoglobin contributes between 60-90$\%$ to NIR signals and is thought to remain constant during exercise (See @davis13).
