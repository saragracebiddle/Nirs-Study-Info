  Ischemic cuff occlusion method to determine recovery rate constant. Sixteen participants, eight men and eight women. Two separate visits with two measurements on each visit for a total of four recovery rate constant measurements on the vastus lateralis and medial hamstring to determing within and between visit repeatability of the measurements.
