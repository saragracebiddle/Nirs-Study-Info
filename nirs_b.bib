    This study compares NIRS measured deoxyhemoglobin to VO2 as a predictor of endurance performance, as measured by time to completion. Deoxyhemoglobin was chosen for the NIRS variable because continuous-wave NIRS HHb is less influenced by factors such as skin blood flow, as asserted by Koga et al. 2015. NIRS derived measured were corrected for blood volume changes as described in Ryan, et al 2014.

    Peak exercise power output and VO2 peak were significantly lower in breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls (25+-6, n = 29, 35 +-6, n = 10). Women with breast cancer had reduced exercise capacity prior to cancer therapy.

    This research utilized the Portamon device to measure tissue oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius in 13 male and 13 female participants using repeated, transient arterial occlusions after a brief exercise stimulus (knee extension or plantar flexion for VL and GC respectively). The NIRS measurements were taken twice, on separate days, for repeatability measurements. Participants also completed a step-incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer to exhaustion to determine FAT_{max} and LT, and a ramp incrememental test on a cycle ergometer to detemine VO_{2max}, GET, and RCP. All gas exchange measures were normalized by LBM (lean body mass). Adipose tissue over the NIRS measurement site was measured via ultrasound. NIRS data were corrected for blood volume changes. TSI was not reported as the researchers used HHb for measures of muscle oxygenation kinetics, since HHb is independed of exercise intensity (according to [@ryan2013]). Female participants were an average of 24.7 $\pm$ 3.6 years old with adipose tissue thickness over the VL an average of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.22 cm. These participants had an average body mass of 58.7 $\pm$ 7.2 kg with lean body mass of 44.1 $\pm$ 5.2 kg, and VO_{2max} normalized for LBM of 54.9 $\pm$ 4.5 mL/kg LBM/min. NIRS derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for females in the vastus lateralis was 20.7 $\pm$ 4.4 seconds. Day-to-day reliability measures found a CV of $8.7\%$ and ICC of 0.793 for female vastus lateralis tau measurements.

    The study decreased oxygen in the room in steps to induce hypoxia and compared blood draws with NIRS measured oxygen content. In order for an oximeter to get clearance as a medical device in the United States, the FDA prefers for oximeter validations to use blood references.
