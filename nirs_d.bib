    The data simulation approach can provide the researcher with useful knowledge about how changes in variables and different modeling and sampling techniques effect model results. This approach also allows the researcher to estimate power for complex models like a mixed effects model. You can also perform a sensitivity analysis, where power and sample size are held constant to determine the minimum effect size that would result in a significant result. You can also set effect size to zero and determine the rate of false positives from your model. R code is available on OSF.

    This paper models the [HHb] signal during tranitions to heavy and moderate exercise. It assumes that the [HHb] signal can be regarded as being essentially blood volume insensitive during exercise.

    This study determmined that NIRS assessment of maximums and minimums was higly reliable across trials of a single session but was not reliable on two separate occasions. Reoxygenation rate was calculated for each parameter as the upslope of TSI, [HHb], [O2Hb], and [Hb_diff] between the start and end of the reoxygenation curve, as well as the intercept and the coefficient of determination {r^2}.
