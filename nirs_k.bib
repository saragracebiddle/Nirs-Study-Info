  Vastus lateralis showed faster and larger changes in [Hhb] during on and off transitions than either rectus femoris measurement. Vastus lateralis also showed increases in [totalHb] at the onset of exercise larger than the rectus femoris.

The results indicate that the presence of light has an effect on oximetry readings, however the presence of such an effect is dependent upon the device being used.
