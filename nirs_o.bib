  Extremely useful for finding sources on factors influencing fNIRS experimentation and solutions. This article breaks down factors into several categories : Environmental, Instrumentation, Mechanical, Population, Physiological, and Study Design/Data Analysis. Environmental factors include ambient light. Solutions include covering the optodes with something opaque. Optode calibration, an Instrumentation factor, can be conducted using algorithms, or for coninuous-wave systems, a simple normalization. This article recommends turning the LEDs on at least 30 minutes prior to data aquisition to allow for appropriate heating. Saturation effects and strategies to detect and remove them are discussed in section 4.4 on page 5. It is recommended to remove instrumental noise before using the Modified-Beer Lambert Law to convert optical densities into haemodynamic data. Abrupt movement may disturb optode-skin coupling which is shown in data as a large sudden change in chromophore concentration. These changes are not due to changes in hemoglobin concentration and will be more irregular than system noise. Section 5.3.2 discusses several algorithms for identifying and removing data contaminated by optode movement or loss of good optode-skin coupling.
