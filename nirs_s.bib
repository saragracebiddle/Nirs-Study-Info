    Defined the SQI as a numeric scale from 1 (very low quality) to 5 ( very high qulity) to quantitatively assess fNIRS signal quality. The SQI uses the optical densitites (OD) and hemoglobin measurements (O2Hb and HHb). Data must be preprocessed by first detrending the the signal segments by subtracting the least squares fit of a straight line to the data. Then, the signals were band-pass filtered using a zero-phase forward Hamming-windowed sinc FIR fitler of order 208 with cutoff frequencies (-6dB) of 0.4 Hz and 3Hz.

    Stage 1 of rating involved identifying very low quality signals. First, OD should fall within the range of 0.04 OD and 2.5 OD to be considered good quality. If the signal segment exceeds those thresholds, it is not considered a good quality signal. Second, the standard devation of the ODs per wavelength should be greater than 0. If the standard deviation of the ODs per wavelength is 0, then there was probably poor scalp coupling and can be labelled a very low quality signal. Third, the sum of the absolute values of the O2Hb signals should be greater than the sum of the absolute values of the HHb signals. The threshold of the ratio of sum O2Hb to sum HHb was derived from the training data set and set to be 1.95.

    Stage 2 of rating involved identifying very high quality signals. Very high quality signals have a similar amplitude and shape of the autocorrelation for the two optical densities of a signal segment, therefore the standard devation between them should be low. A threshold for the standard deviation of the difference between optical density signals autocorrelation was set to 0.025. If the value falls below 0.025 for the signal segment, that signal segment is considered a very high quality signal.

    Stage 3 of rating involved assigning a numerical value, 1-5, for the quality of the signal segment. The output of the logarithm of the ratio between the standard deviation of O2Hb and HHb was used to quantitatively rate the signal quality. High quality fNIRS signals show a strong heartbeat in O2Hb data and less strong of a heartbeat in HHb data, therefore the standard deviation of O2Hb should be greater than the standard deviation of HHb.

    100 critically ill children up to the age of 8 with a central venous catheter were recruited to participate in the study. The NIRS probe (NIRO-300) was places overlying the palpable liver and directly below the right costal arch, with an inter-optode distance of 40 mm and shielded from ambient light. The NIRO-300 uses SRS principles with 4 laser diodes to obtain absolute measures for TOI. NIRS were taken at a sample rate of 2 seconds for 15 minutes, at which time blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter and SvO_2 was measured oximetrically. TOI and SvO_2 were positively correlated (r = 0.72) with the strongest correlation between TOI and SvO_2 when the catherter tip was located in the right atrium and without intra-cardia left-to-right shunt or sepsis (n=23, r = 0.88). Multivariate regression revealed SvO_2 explained up to 51\% of the observed variance in TOI, with the addition of variables age, hemoglobin concentration, SaO_2, FOE,Ca-vO_2, VCV tip position, positive pressure ventilation, sepsis, and intra-cardiac shunts only increasing the proportion of explained variance to 52.4\%. TOI and SvO_2 are good mutual predictors however they appear to be independent variables.
