    Internal reliability of the BFI when measuring a single dimension- the severity of fatigue. Sample included 305 inpatient and outpatient adults with cancer and a comparison sample of 290 community-dwelling adults. Fatigue severity can be categorized as either 'severe' or 'non-severe' with a BFI score greater than or equal to 7 indicating severe fatigue and a BFI score less than 7 indicating non-severe fatigue levels.
