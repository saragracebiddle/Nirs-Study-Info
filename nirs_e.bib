    Cancer survivors (n = 8) compared to controls (n = 9). Cancer survivors all had chemotherapy treatment and five also had radiation treatment. Participants completed an incremental ramp test on a cycle ergometer to ventilatory threshold. [Hb]tot and [HHb] were significantly lower in cancer survivors compared to controls at ventilatory threshold. The rate of change for TOI and [HHb] relative to VO2 were decreased in cancer survivors compared to controls. The type of cancer of participants was not reported.
