    10 pediatric patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization were recruited for participation. The NIRS probe (INVOS 5100C) was place on the ninth right rib in the midaxillary line and a second NIRS was used to monitor cerebral oxygenation. Two blood samples were drawn from the heaptic vein and compared with the simultaneous measurement by NIRS. The directly measured hepatic vein saturation was not correlated with the NIRS measured saturation. This may be due to the fact that hepatic blood flow is not well understood and some areas of the liver may receive no portal venous input. Also, ultrasound was not used to measure the depth of the liver from the skin surface. Since the probe was placed directly over the rib, the bone may have affected the measurement of liver blood flow. The researchers may have benefitted from using the HomER algorithm to correct for bone. Also, the paper does not well elucidate which NIRS signal they use when they refer to rSO_2-H. The researchers chose a line graph with dual lines for portal vein saturation and NIRS measured saturation when a scatterplot demonstrating a lack of correlation would have been more appropriate. The researchers may have benefitted from using an ultrasound to determine the depth of the liver with respect to the NIRS probe in order to determine whether the signal truly reached the depth of the liver tissue.
