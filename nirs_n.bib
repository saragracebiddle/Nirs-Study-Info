    note = {\\
    This study asserts that adipose tissue thickness has an effect on NIRS-SRS tissue oxygenation index, referred to as StO2, by overestimating actual skeletal muscle oxygenation and decreasing the sensitivity to dexoxygenation measures. Adipose tissue thickness was the only variable that significantly correlated with the change in StO2 during exercise. Adipose tissue thickness explained 33$\%$ of variability of resting tissue oxygenation for adipose tissue thicknesses between 1.0 and 17.5 millimeters.
