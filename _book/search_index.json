Spatially resolved NIRS devices use multiple transmitters at different distances from a reciever to calculate a Tissue Saturation Index, or TSI. The NIRS device utilized in this study is the PortaMon by Artinis Medical Systems. The PortaMon could be considered both a continuous wave and spatially resolved device. It uses three continuous-wave transmitters with a single receiver to calculate the TSI. Each transmitter emits two wavelengths of infrared light. One wavelength is for oxygenated hemoglobin and one wavelength is for deoxygenated hemoglobin, therefore each transmitter measures both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The transmitters emit light into tissue where the light waves bounce off structures in the tissue and return to the receiver. The receiver measures the light that returns in Optical Densities. Calculations using several different parameters and assumptions convert OD into usable units. Subcutaneous adipose tissue has different optical properties than muscle tissue. Most calculations do not account for two separate layers of tissue with different scattering and optical properties. There have been some papers within the last few years examining multi-layered tissues and the effects on NIRS measurements using computer modeling and phantom tissues. Most papers utilizing NIRS in exercise physiology assume a limited or negligible effect of adipose tissue thickness on measurements and report participants’ adipose tissue thickness. Different areas of the body have different types of tissue structure and this have different optical properties. Previous papers have reported the measurements of optical properties at various locations of the body. Consult with the device manufacturer and reports of these optical properties to determine the best settings for your device. Most studies assume that the tissue structures have constant optical properties. This may not hold true, especially during activities like exercise where blood flow increases and the contents of blood fluctuate. Accounting for varying optical properties has led to the development of time-domain and other measurement techniques. These devices are more expensive than a continuous wave device. Therefore, most NIRS devices assume constant optical properties of the measured tissues. The differential pathlength factor (dpf) is the measurement of the path that the light waves take through tissue. DPF values have been well researched and measured for multiple body locations and differing adipose tissue thicknesses. This parameter is used in calculating TSI.

EPIC access must be granted by Prisma Health. Use the Production Environment of EPIC. In the Production Environment, you can create and run reports that you cannot in the Read Only Environment. However, take care in the Production Environment not to accidentally edit any patient charts. Log in with your Prisma Health log in information and select the department CANCER-FARIS ONCOLOGY [100224000]. When a patient is identified as potentially eligible, create a research study association () in their chart of type Identified. I also like to use the My Sticky Note. 3.2.1 Using a Report Reports can be useful for identifying patients that match certain parameters. However, reports rely entirely on the criteria in the report. For example, when using a report to identify patients with a treatment plan that includes chemotherapy, the treatment plan has to have been put in EPIC for the report to see it. If the notes say that the patient will have a certain treatment plan but the plan is not put in EPIC yet, then the report will not include that patient. This creates some difficulties when using reports, but they can be a good starting point. Go to My Reports. 3.2.1.1 Find Patients Eligible for NIRS by Treatment Plan This report returns a list of patients with a diagnosis of breast or primary gynecological cancer patients that have an active chemotherapy treatment plan with one of the doctors that refers to the NIRS study. Due to the long list of criteria, this report can take a few minutes to run. The results list displays the following information: treatment plan start date, next oncology appointment date, name, MRN, clinical stage, diagnosis, and plan provider. The Oncology Snapshot is displayed under the report results when a row is selected. 3.2.1.2 Find Upcoming New Consult Appointments with NIRS Providers This report returns a list of upcoming appointments with one of the doctors that refer to the NIRS study that are type ‘New Consult’ or ‘MDC’. Appointments of this type are generally new diagnoses that do not yet have a treatment plan. If the patient meets all criteria except for the treatment plan, you can send the patient’s information to the research coordinators and they can watch the patient for further treatment planning. 3.2.1.3 PH Find Patients Identified for NIRS Study This report returns a list of patients with a study association to the NIRS study of type Identified. 3.2.1.4 PH Find Patients Associated with NIRS Study This report returns a list of patients with any study association to the NRIS study. Sometimes metastatic disease is listed as a second diagnosis and therefore slips through the exclusion of metastatic disease. Vascular diseases and injuries that would preclude ability to exercise are other common exclusion criteria. Male patients with breast cancer are not eligible for this study. Take a quick look through the patient’s problem list. If the patient does not have any immediate exclusionary problems, pass their name and MRN on to research coordinator Sydney Hackwell. She will conduct a full chart screening and contact the patient if they are eligible. I include all patients returned by the report into the List. This is because, from day to day, the report returns different patients. If a patient is not in the List, I will assume that I have not yet looked at their chart. So, even if I look at a chart and immediately determine that a patient is not eligible, I write their information into the List and mark them ineligible so I don’t forget that I already screened their chart. This also helps determine if there are new potentially eligible patients returned by the report. On average, the report will return between 5 and 10 patients. Due to the month long limit on treatment plan start date, the report will return the same patients for many days in a row. If you don’t keep track of everyone that the report returned, even the ineligible ones, you may get confused about which patients need to be screened and which ones you have already screened. 3.2.2 Using the Schedule Open the Schedule tab. If there is not a schedule view that you like, you can make your own by clicking the green plus sign above My Schedule. Give it a name. I called mine nirs providers. Under Selected Columns you can choose what information you want to display about the appointment. Under Configuration, you can add the providers. I added all five oncologists. Now when you select that schedule, you will only see the five oncologists that refer to the NIRS study. To take a closer look at an appointment, expand the schedule by clicking the gray triangle next to the name of the schedule. Click on the provider name whose schedule you are interested in. This will expand the schedule of only that provider, where you can see more details about their appointments. Use the calendar in the top left to select different days. Click on an appointment you are interested in examining further. This should open up a panel to the right of the schedule. I have this set up to show Snapshot as the default view. You can rearrange the panels shown in the snapshot by clicking on the wrench in the top right of the snapshot panel. I use the schedule to screen patients coming in to the Multidisciplinary Clinic (MDC). Jorgensen has appointments in the MDC every other Monday. Stephenson has appointments in the MDC every other Thursday. Screen these appointments at least one day before. Many will not have a chemotherapy plan or a cancer staging activity yet. Look for major health problems that would disqualify them from participation. If there are no major problems, pass the appointment information on to Katie and Sydney. If a patient has triple negative or estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative breast cancer, they are likely to receive chemotherapy and Katie or Sydney can contact them as soon as the chemotherapy is prescribed. This gives us more time for recruitment into the study, as Katie and Sydney can be at the MDC appointment or at the appointment where they are told about the chemotherapy, which is a lot more time than waiting until the chemo teach appointment to approach a patient. 3.3 Potential Patient List I use a Microsoft List, created in my PrismaHealth OneDrive, to share the patient information with Katie and Syndey rather than sending tons of emails. I update the list when I identify potentially eligible patients. I include the patient’s MRN, first and last name, primary diagnosis (breast or gynecological), and which of the referring oncologists is on their treatment team. If they have an upcoming appointment that Katie or Sydney could go to and tell them about the study, I include the appointment information. If their first chemotherapy infusion is scheduled, I include that date so that we know how long we have to recruit and schedule them in the HPL. Katie and Sydney look through the list and conduct a more in depth chart screening. If they determine that a patient is not eligible, they click the Ineligible tag in the List and include reasons that the patient is not eligible. The categories of ineligibility that I included as defaults are: metastatic disease, chemotherapy treatment within the last five years, lab values, treatment plan other than chemotherapy. You can type in any new category you need; you are not limited to just the default ineligibility values. If a patient is determined to be eligible, one of the Research Coordinators will contact their oncologist to get permission to approach the patient at their next appointment. If the provider declines the study for them, then the patient is marked as Declined in the List. If the provider consents for the patient to be approached about the study, then one of the Research Coordinators will approach the patient at their next appointment. The patient will then either sign a consent or decline the study. If they decline the study, click the Declined tag in the List. Include a reason that they declined, such as stress, not enough time, etc. After contacting the patient, they will contact you if the patient signs the consent form. After the consent form is signed, we can begin contacting the patient to start scheduling for lab visits. Contact Dr. Julie Martin after obtaining the consent form and she will put all NIRS related blood draws into EPIC. If for some reason we are not able to get the NIRS draws done at the same time as the other pre-chemo blood draws, consult with the patient and schedule this through Dr. Julie Martin. If a patient is not wearing shorts for a lab visit, there are disposable shorts in the lab for patient use. They are located in a box under the bed in the back corner. 3.4 Travel Expenses If a patient lives more than 50 miles from the Cancer Institute, they are eligible for travel expenses to be reimbursed. Use a map service, such as Google Maps, to map the driving distance between their address and the Cancer Institute. The Greenphire ClinCard is a re-loadable debit card that we use for reimbursement purposes. Have the patient fill out a W-9 if they qualify for the ClinCard. Sara Biddle has access to the ClinCard Admin Portal. If you need to get access to the ClinCard Admin Portal, contact Jan Keuber at the Clinical Research Management Office for help. The ClinCard for the NIRS study is currently programmed for up to 10 visits to the lab. Each visit can reimburse up to $125 for any travel or hotel expenses. 3.5 After a Consent After a patient has signed the informed consent, the research coordinator will use the RedCap survey to fill out the basic information about a patient and assign the patient a study ID number. "],["DataCollection.html", "Chapter 4 Data Collection 4.1 Lactate Threshold Visit (First Visit) 4.2 On/Off Kinetics Visit", " Chapter 4 Data Collection Everyone is required to wear a mask while the patient is in the lab. Prisma Health keeps a supply of masks in the hallway that connects to the parking garage. Since our patients are receiving chemotherapy and their immune systems will not be functioning well during chemotherapy treatment, the principal investigators decided masking is required. Patients and any people they bring with them are not required to wear masks. If they wish to, direct them to the supply of masks in the hallway. 4.1 Lactate Threshold Visit (First Visit) This protocol is the participant’s first visit to the lab. Have any medical students helping out with testing arrive to the lab at least 30 minutes prior to the participant. 4.1.1 Preparation Turn on the PARVO computer. At least an hour prior to the time the participant is scheduled to arrive, turn on the metabolic cart by flipping the power switch on the extension cord at the back of the cart. Turn on the computer monitor and wait for the screen to load. Press F1. Enter the password to log in. The PARVOMedics software will open automatically. Set the date and time on the PARVO computer. In the bottom right, click on the date and open the date and time settings. Change the date and time to today’s date and time. Prepare the patient’s folder. Look in the filing cabinet for the folder labelled with the patient’s study ID. Get it out. If the patient doesn’t have a folder yet, look in the very back of the top drawer of the cabinet. Frankie keeps some folders in the back that will have all the forms needed for a lactate threshold test. Write the patient’s ID number on the folder tab. Check in the folder for the following forms: MMSE C.3 Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire C.2 Physical Activity Intake C.4 BFI C.1 PROMIS Global Health C.5 Lactate Threshold Data Collection Sheet Contact Information Form If you cannot find them or need to print more, you can download the forms you need from the file repository in RedCap. Log in to Frankie or Sara’s desktop computer in order to print to the HPL printer. The HPL printer is VV82. Label the forms. Write the patient’s study ID number, visit ID, and the date in the upper left corner of each sheet in pen. For Lactate Threshold Visits, the visit ID is LT. Place the MMSE, GLTEQ, Lactate Threshold Data Collection Sheet, and an extra sheet of blank printer paper on one clipboard. These will be filled out by laboratory staff. Place the BFI, PROMIS Global Health, Contact Information Form, and Physical Activity History (Intake) forms on a different clipboard. These will be filled out by the participant. Put a pen with the clipboard for the patient to use when filling out the forms. Assemble the VO2 mask except for the blue rubber part as described in B.2.3. Place the assembled pieces in a sterile pink bucket. Prepare the PortaMon. Prepare the device by putting in a charged battery, wrapping the PortaMon in plastic saran wrap, and placing the double sided taupe tape. For more details, see ??. Connect the PortaMon to the Oxysoft software as described in A.6 but do not begin data collection. Leave the screen on the pop up where you would click Finish. Run lactate meter controls as described in D.2.1.1. Get a washcloth out of the cabinet behind the door and put it by the ultrasound to wipe off ultrasound gel during device placement. Calibrate the PARVO. CHECK THE TIME. THE PARVO COMPUTER MUST HAVE BEEN ON FOR MORE THAN 30 MINUTES TO PROCEED WITH CALIBRATION. DOUBLE CHECK THAT THE DATE AND TIME ON THE PARVO HAVE BEEN RE-SET BEFORE DOING THE CALIBRATION. Do the gas calibration as described in B.2.1. Only save the calibration results if the percent change in CO2 is less than 1%. If the percent change is greater than 1% (either positive or negative change), open the door, turn on the fan, wait ten minutes and try again. If the percent change is greater than 1% and there is no more time, save the most recent gas calibration and make sure to tell Frankie Bennet about it. Write down the humidity, room temperature, barometric pressure, and percent change in CO2 from the gas calibration on the data collection sheet. Do the flowmeter calibration as described in B.2.1. If you do the gas calibration prior to doing the flowmeter calibration, the PARVO software will automatically fill in the humidity, room temperature, and barometric pressure as saved from the gas calibration. The percent change should be less than 1%. If it is greater than 1%, do not save and try again in 10 minutes. Open the exercise test in the PARVOMedics software. In the first and last name inputs, type in the NIRS ID number and visit ID (NIRS_ID#_LT_MM_DD_YYYY). The first and last name inputs will match. Input the patient’s age in the appropriate input section. You will get the patient’s height and weight after they arrive. Click Save in the upper right corner. On the stationary bike setting screen, it will display TODO. Press the circular button. It should now display TODO. Press the circular button again. The screen should display TODO. Approximately 10-15 minutes before the patient is supposed to arrive, send someone to the Cancer Institute lobby to meet them. They will walk the patient up to the Human Performance Lab. 4.1.2 Exclusion Criteria There are three exclusion criteria that we must test before continuing with any data collection. Adipose Tissue Thickness In order for the PortaMon to collect useful data, the subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness above the vastus lateralis and directly under the device must be less than 2 centimeters. Use the steps described in D.1.1 to measure the participant’s subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness above their vastus lateralis. If ATT is less than 2 centimeters, the participant continues through the next steps. Place the NIRS device over the area measured using ultrasound following the steps described in A.7. Be sure to take a picture of the device placement on the vastus lateralis. Place the tape measure so that 0 is on the top of the patient’s patella and lay the tape measure to the side of the PortaMon. Sufficient Physical Activity Sedentary patients will be unable to complete the testing protocol and thus will be excluded from participation. To determine physical activity levels, administer the Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire C.2. If the score is less than 14, the patient would be sedentary and will not be eligible to participate. Administer the GLTEQ to the patient and score it immediately. Mental State Patients must be aware of their situation and fully able to consent to participation. The Mini-Mental State Examination C.3 helps detect any underlying issues with memory that would render a patient unable to participate. If the patient scores less than TODO, the patient will not be eligible to participate due to mental conditions. Administer the MMSE to the patient and score it immediately. 4.1.3 Data Collection Have the subject complete the following instruments: Physical Activity History C.4 BFI C.1 PROMIS Global Health C.5 Review the completed Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire and Physical Activity History instruments. Use your best judgement in collaboration with the other investigators to determine the wattage jumps. See E.2.2 for further information about deciding wattage jumps. Take the patient’s blood pressure. Write down the blood pressure on the data collection sheet. Take the patient’s oral temperature. Write down the oral temperature on the data collection sheet. Take the patient’s blood pressure a second time. Write down the blood pressure on the data collection sheet. Size the participant for the VO2 mask by holding the sizing chart up to their face. Select the appropriate VO2 mask and attach it to the assembled parts of the mask. Record the measured mask size on the data collection sheet. Have the patient take off their shoes and take their weight, twice. Write down both weights on the data collection sheet. Do not say the weight out loud, just have the person writing down the weight stand beside the scale and write it down. Have the patient stand on the scale and get their height. Have them step off the scale and step back on to get their height a second time. Write down both height measurements on the data collection sheet. Have any men leave the room. Spray the HR monitor sensor with water from the spray bottle. Place the heart rate monitor under the patient’s bra strap over their sternum. Check that the HR monitor is getting a good signal by turning on the watch. If the HR monitor is not getting a good signal, make sure the whole sensor on the inside of the strap is touching skin and not over the bra. Try to move the sensor higher on the chest. Put more water in between the sensor and the skin. Before having the patient get on the stationary bike, explain the testing protocol to the patient. Make sure they understand that there will be finger pricks, stationary biking up to 20 minutes (but hopefully less if we estimated correctly), and no rest time during this test. Explain the RPE scale and how it will be used during testing. Have the patient get on the stationary bike. Adjust the seat height and handlebars as needed. If the PortaMon has been on for at least 10 minutes, proceed. Place the assembled mask on the participant’s face. Check that the mask is properly fitted and forms an airtight seal. Connect the clear tubing to the clear end of the mask. Make sure the patient’s weight was input in the exercise testing input on the PARVO computer. Start the test on the PARVO. Write down the time on the NIRS computer that the PARVO test was initiated. Conduct Lactate Threshold Exercise Test as described in E.2. Take the mask off the patient’s face. Help the patient get off the bike. Remove the NIRS device and the heart rate monitor. Walk the patient back down to the lobby. Thank them for their time and participation. 4.1.4 After Data Collection Clean and put away equipment. Pull the saran wrap and tape off of the PortaMon and throw it away. Remove the PortaMon battery and charge it. Remove all dirty PARVO parts and place in pink bucket. Wipe down the outside of the PortaMon case with antibacterial wipes. Remove the button from the heart rate monitor. Wipe the button down with antibacterial wipes and put the heart rate monitor strap in the pink bucket to be cleaned with the PARVO mask parts. Take the pink bucket and put it on the blue cart. Follow the steps described in @ref() to clean and sanitize the pieces. Make sure all needles from finger pricks are disposed of in the sharps container. Throw away all used gauze and antibacterial wipes. Save PortaMon data. Click File in the upper left. Click Save project file. Open the Windows File Explorer. If NIRS Data is not under Quick Access in the top left, use the following file path to get to the appropriate folder: This PC/OS (C:)/Artinis NIRS/NIRS Data Find the file just created. Its name will match what was typed in when the measurement was created. It will have the extension .oxy4. Make a copy of that file. DO NOT delete the file from this location. Go to the desktop. Open the folder NIRS FILES. Open the appropriate patient’s folder. Save the copy of the measurement in this folder. Rename the measurement as needed to match the naming convention within the folder. Open RedCap. Go to the File Repository. Open the folder OXYSOFT. Open the folder Oxy4 Files. Open the appropriate patient’s folder. Upload the .oxy4 file. Save PARVO data. Print out the 10-second report of the data collected by the PARVO and place with the other data collection sheets. Export the PARVO data as an .XML file as “breath by breath”. Since the PARVO computer is not connected to the internet, you must use a USB drive to transfer the files off of the PARVO computer. Make a copy of the exported file and save it on the USB drive. Safely eject the USB drive from the PARVO computer. Use a different computer with internet access to upload the copy of the PARVO file into the RedCap File Repository. In the File Repository, open the PARVO folder. Open the Breath by Breath folder. Open the appropriate patient’s folder. Upload the .XML file. Save Other data. Measure the seat height, seat depth, and pedal length of the stationary bike and record on the data collection sheet. 4.2 On/Off Kinetics Visit 4.2.1 Preparation Turn on the PARVO. At least an hour prior to the time the participant is scheduled to arrive, turn on the metabolic cart by flipping the power switch on the extension cord at the back of the cart. Turn on the computer monitor and wait for the screen to load. Press F1. Enter the password to log in. The PARVOMedics software will open automatically. Set the date and time on the PARVO computer. In the bottom right, click on the date and open the date and time settings. Change the date and time to today’s date and time. Get the patient’s folder out of the locked filing cabinet. Ensure the following forms are printed out: Physical Activity History (Follow Up) BFI PROMIS Global Health On/Off Kinetics Data Collection Sheet Label the forms. Write the patient’s study ID number, visit ID, and the date in the upper left corner of each sheet in pen. For On/Off Kinetics Visits, the visit ID is FP. Place the Full Protocol Data Collection Sheet on one clipboard. This will be filled out by laboratory staff. Place the BFI, PROMIS Global Health, and Physical Activity History (Follow Up) forms on a different clipboard. These will be filled out by the participant. Put a pen with the clipboard for the patient to use when filling out the forms. Assemble the VO2 mask. Place the assembled pieces in a sterile pink bucket. Prepare the PortaMon as described in ?? by putting in a charged battery, wrapping the PortaMon in plastic saran wrap, and placing the double sided taupe tape. If the PARVO has been on for more than 30 minutes, do the gas calibration as described in B.2.1. Make sure the date and time have been changed before doing the calibration. Only save the calibration results if the percent change in CO2 is less than 1%. If the percent change is greater than 1% (either positive or negative change), open the door, turn on the fan, wait ten minutes and try again. If the percent change is greater than 1% and there is no more time, save the most recent gas calibration and make sure to tell Frankie Bennet about it. Write down the humidity, room temperature, and barometric pressure from the gas calibration on the data collection sheet. Do the flowmeter calibration as described in B.2.1. _ If you do the gas calibration prior to doing the flowmeter calibration, the PARVO software will automatically fill in the humidity, room temperature, and barometric pressure as saved from the gas calibration. The percent change should be less than 1%. If it is greater than 1%, do not save and try again in 10 minutes. Open the exercise test in the PARVOMedics software. In the first and last name inputs, type in the NIRS ID number and visit ID (NIRS_ID#_FP_CYCLE#). The first and last name inputs will match. Input the patient’s age in the appropriate input section.

Help the patient get off the bike. Remove the NIRS device and the heart rate monitor. Walk the patient back down to the lobby. Thank them for their time and participation. "],["DataStorage.html", "Chapter 5 Data Storage 5.1 Missing Data Codes", " Chapter 5 Data Storage Follow all appropriate data export instructions for PARVO and NIRS data. All physical copies are stored in a locked filing cabinet in the Human Performance Lab. The study RedCap stores all identifying patient information and digital copies of data. After a patient is identified and signs a consent form for the study, the research coordinator will fill out the New Patient survey in RedCap. When this survey is completed, it automatically assigns a study ID number to the patient and sends an email to Frankie Bennett and Sara Biddle about the newly consented participant. When a patient completes an HPL visit, go to the patient’s record in RedCap. 5.1 Missing Data Codes The following missing data codes are enabled in RedCap: INV, Invalid NA, Not Applicable OTH, Other NI, No Information When inputting data into RedCap, use the following guidelines to determine which missing data code to use. You can input a missing data code by selecting the M next to the input field. If the item is blank, as in not answered or no one wrote it down on the data collection sheet, use NI, No Information. If the item had an error during data collection, for example if the lactate meter shows ERR, use INV, Invalid. If the item was not used during data collection, use NA, Not Applicable. If the reason does not fit into any of the above categories, use OTH, Other and record a comment by clicking on the text bubble icon and typing into the notes field. 5.1.1 Patient Information After consenting the new patient, open up the patient’s chart in Epic and fill out the forms under Patient Information. 5.1.2 Lactate Threshold Visit Under the Lactate Threshold event in the appropriate patient record in RedCap, start filling out the data collection instruments for the event. Fill out the following data collection instruments: HPL Visit, One-Time Measurements, Lactate Parvo, Godin Leisuretime Exercise Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination, Brief Fatigue Inventory, PROMIS SF v1.1-Global Health, Physical Activity, and Data Files. The information to fill out HPL Visit, One-Time Measurements, and Lactate Parvo will be found on the Lactate Threshold Data Collection Sheet that was filled out during the patient visit. "],["DataAnalysis.html", "Chapter 6 Data Analysis 6.1 Lactate Threshold 6.2 On/Off Kinetics", " Chapter 6 Data Analysis Be sure you have exported and stored all data appropriately. 6.1 Lactate Threshold Take the lactate threshold data collection sheet. Average the duplicate lactate measurements for each completed stage. Use an online calculator for getting the equation for a line from two points. Take the power in Watts and lactate in mMol/L from the stage where lactate was below 4.0 and above 4.0. Input the lactate as x and the power as y in the calculator. For example, if two stages were as follows: Power Average Lactate 50 W 3.1 65 W 4.5 then the power and lactate would be input in the calculator as follows: First Point x1 = 3.1 y1 = 50 Second Point x2 = 4.5 y2 = 65 The calculator will display the line equation below the inputs. Take the equation in y=mx+b format and input x = 4.0 to get the power at which lactate was 4.0. This is the power at lactate threshold. Multiply this power by 1.1 to calculate the power at which the patient will conduct subsequent on/off kinetics testing. 6.2 On/Off Kinetics 6.2.1 Using the App Use the exported .txt file. Upload this file into the Shiny app. Refer to the data collection sheet and find the time on the NIRS that the exercise test started. Input this time. Look at the graph of the data. Make sure that the transitions are at the appropriate times on the graph. The graph should end on a rest stage. The transitions between stages should occur at the labelled vertical lines on the graph. If the graph seems a little off, you can adjust the start time by a few seconds to align the timing of the transitions as close as possible to the labelled lines on the graph. Once the graph of the raw data looks correct, look at the plotted regressions. The gray is the raw data and the red is the regression line. The red should follow the gray raw data as closely as possible. If the regression does not seem to follow this at all, you can try adjusting the transition time variable. This will remove a few seconds from the beginning and end of the stage, where the patient may have been moving around on the bike or adjusting from the previous stage. Check to make sure that removing the time made a beneficial difference. Sometimes removing the transition time is helpful and sometimes it makes things worse so try several values and check the regression lines each time. 6.2.2 In R Make sure you have followed instructions (see F) to prepare your RStudio workspace befor beginning. Read in the exported PortaMon data. Open the R script file for the patient. Copy a code chunk for the analysis of one data set. Paste it after the most recent data set. At the top of the script, add the start time to the start time vector. Oxysoft allows you to add in ‘Events’ to the measurements, kind of like time markers. However, when you export the measurements after adding an ‘Event’, Oxysoft adds an extra column that is mostly empty except for where the ‘Event’ was added in. Most read functions do not like this and will throw an error when you try to read in the data. The function I wrote will take the file and throw out the extra ‘Event’ column. Oxysoft also adds metadata to the header of the file. Most read in functions do not like this either, as they will look to the top of the file to figure out what the rest of the file looks like. read_nirs will parse the metadata for the information we would like to keep. Then it reads the actual data as a data frame. The useful metadata pieces are passed on to the user as attributes of the raw data frame. The PortaMon does not record in increments of time, it records the sample number. The PortaMon records data at a rate of 10 hz, so it takes 10 samples a second. The time in seconds from the start of the test is the sample number divided by 10. The PortaMon was on and collecting data from the time the device was placed until the end of the exercise test. We aren’t interested in the data from before the start of the exercise test, so that can be removed. The best way to do this is to create a new column, named something like zeroed_time or time_aligned, and calculate it such that time = 0 in the zeroed_time column is the start time of the test. Everything before that is a negative time and everything after is positive. Then you can filter on zeroed_time &gt; 0. Why not just filter on time &gt; start_time? If the start time written on the data collection sheet was off by a few seconds (which it often is), you cannot go back and readjust it, especially not if the time needs to be adjusted backwards. You can easily re-calculate the zeroed_time column based on the original time column, using the same data frame. And you don’t have to remember the start times of every data frame. If every data frame has been read in and time adjusted, then every data frame just needs to be filtered on zeroed_time &gt; 0. Plot the raw data to be sure that you removed all extraneous data from the beginning of the data frame. Make adjustments to the start time as needed. Next, find the time chunks for each section of the test. An on/off kinetics consists of the following sections, each 2 minutes (120 seconds) in duration: Baseline Rest, Warm Up, Work 1, Rest 1, Work 2, Rest 2, Work 3, and Rest 3. Plot the exercise test. On the x axis, use time in seconds. Have dual y axes, one with hemoglobin arbitrary units and one with percentages. Plot all signals (O2Hb and HHb for all exported transmitters and TSI) over time and check that the transitions between sections line up with the expected times. Adjust slightly as necessary, as the start time recorded for the test may be silghtly off due to human error / time taken for the PARVO to begin the test. Use the plot and notes from the test to examine the data for movement artifacts that need to be removed before analysis. Remove as necessary. The oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin measurements have arbitrary units- they are change in oxy and deoxyhemoglobin. This means that we cannot use the amounts of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and compare those over time. For example, the average oxyhemoglobin at rest could be measured as 4 for one test and 6 at the next test. This does not mean that at the second test, the amount of oxyhemoglobin in the blood was actually higher than at the first test. Average the O2Hb and HHb across the transmitters. Calculate the steady state at the end of each non-baseline and non-warm up section (6 sections in total- 3 work sections and 3 rest sections) by averaging the last 30 seconds of the section for each signal type (O2Hb, HHb, and TSI). There are 18 steady state values: 3 signal types and 6 sections. Calculate the delta steady state for each transition. Subtract the rest steady state from the corresponding work steady state. I.e. subtract rest 1 steady state from work 1 steady state. There are 9 delta steady state values: 3 signal types and 3 transitions. We use the following equation to describe an asymptotic or monoexponential curve: \\[y =({Asym}-B_0) - ({Asym}-B_0)*e^{-t/ \\tau} \\] Where \\({Asym}\\) is the asymptote (or Steady State), \\(B_0\\) is the value at time 0, \\(t\\) is the time (in seconds), and \\(\\tau\\) is the time constant. Calculate the coefficients for the monoexponential curve for each transition. There are 9 monoexponential curve equations: 3 signal types and 3 transitions. When you are satisfied with the results obtained from the app, download the report and upload it into the RedCap.

It uses one receiver with three infrared transmitters. Each transmitter is 5 millimeters further from the receiver. This allows the application of mathematical formulas to calculate an absolute tissue hemoglobin saturation, which Artinis Medical Systems refers to as the Tissue Saturation Index, or TSI. In the literature, this is referred to by various acronyms, such as TOI (Tissue Oxygenation Index). A full examination of the mathematics and physics behind the calculation of TSI was published as part of the SPIE Conference on Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy of Tissue III in 1999.1 The yellow case is one unit. It contains the following: ASUS laptop laptop charging chord with European to American outlet converter yellow Artinis Oxysoft USB Bluetooth dongle ROCKEY4ND license key PortaMon device two batteries battery charging dock micro-USB chord for battery charging dock A.2 Oxysoft Oxysoft is the software by Artinis Medical Systems to connect with their devices, collect data, and do some data processing. Oxysoft is installed on the ASUS laptops that go with the yellow cases. These laptops do not have any PrismaHealth or USC SoMG software on them. If someone should want to install Oxysoft on a PrismaHealth or USC SoMG computer, Oxysoft will have to be approved by the respective organization’s IT team. Oxysoft has been approved to be on Sara Biddle’s PrismaHealth desktop computer by PrismaHealth’s IT. No other PrismaHealth or USC SoMG computers are currently approved to have Oxysoft installed. If you wish to install Oxysoft on a personal computer or have been approved to install Oxysoft on an organization’s computer, plug the yellow Artinis Oxysoft USB into the computer and run the installer. When you open Oxysoft, the software will default open the most recently open project. The project is kind of like a folder that contains individual measurements. When you create a new measurement, the project will save the name of the measurement and the file path to where the .oxy4 file of the measurement was saved. If you do not save the project before closing Oxysoft, the project will forget that you added a new measurement. The .oxy4 file will still exist, but you will not be able to find the measurement in the project. Oxysoft creates files with the extension .oxy4 for every new measurement. These files are automatically stored in a default location on the ASUS laptops. A.3 Batteries The PortaMon batteries can hold up to 8 hours of power for the device. Make sure they are fully charged prior to a patient’s visit. Plug the micro-USB into the battery charging dock. Plug this into an outlet. Place the battery into the dock, sticker side down. The three metal connectors on the narrow side of the battery must be touching the three metal connectors on the charging dock. If the battery is correctly placed in the dock, an LED will light up. When the battery is fully charged, the LED will be green. A.4 Bluetooth Oxysoft uses a legacy Bluetooth dongle to connect to the PortaMon. The ASUS laptops are default set to use legacy Bluetooth settings via the Bluetooth dongle. Other computers are not set up to use the legacy Bluetooth dongle and it is very difficult to make it work. It is easier to collect data on the ASUS laptops, which are default configured to use the Bluetooth dongle, and then export the data for analysis. A.5 Instrument Preparation Place a fully charged battery in the PortaMon, with the three connectors on the battery touching the three connectors in the PortaMon. Slide the top of the PortaMon back in until it clicks into place. If the battery is charged and placed correctly, LEDs on the bottom of the PortaMon will light up. Wrap the PortaMon in clear saran wrap and tape the saran wrap in place. This prevents sweat and other moisture from getting in to the PortaMon. Since the PortaMon has electronic parts, it cannot be sterilized using liquids and the saran wrap means we do not have to sterilize the device itself. When testing is complete, pull saran wrap and tape off the PortaMon and throw it away. Cut the double-sided taupe tape length-wise into two long strips. Place one strip to the left of the transmitters and receiver and one strip to the right of the transmitters and receiver. Leave the exterior side of the double-sided tape covered until the placement on the thigh is complete. A.6 Start a Measurement Turn on the ASUS laptop. Ensure the bluetooth dongle and the Rockey dongle are plugged in to the laptop. The Rockey license key must say ‘ROCKEY4ND’ and NOT ‘ROCKEY4’. The ‘ROCKEY4’ is from an older Artinis device and is not the current license key. You will not be able to use the most up to date Oxysoft software with the incorrect license key. Open Oxysoft. Close any open graphs in the main panel. Select Graphs in the top bar. Select Close all graphs. There should be no open graphs in the main panel. Select Measurement in the top bar. Select Create Measurement and Start Device (Wizard)... from drop down. Name the measurement appropriately. Select the Copy settings from: drop down. Scroll to the top of the drop down and select no copy. Click Next. Pop up will open to add a bluetooth device. Click Add. Pop up will open to select type of device. Select OxyMon/PortaMon/PortaLite/OctaMon, which should be auto filled. Click OK. Select correct device number, this should match the number on the top of the Portamon. Click Connect. Device should pair with the computer. If it does not, try the following steps: Check the device is on. The green LED light should be on. If not, turn on by holding down the button on the left until the lights come on (about three seconds). Hold the bluetooth button down for about three seconds while you click connect on the computer. Unpair the device with the computer in the computer’s bluetooth settings, then re-pair. Restart the computer. Try using the other Portamon. When successfully connected, a blue LED will turn on on the Portamon and the device type and number will be listen in the Combined Devices pop up. Click OK. The Optode-template window will now be open. Under Optode-template: (Filtered by PortaMon) click the drop down. Select Portamon TSI Fit Factor. Under k (1/mm) click the drop down. Select 1.63 (calf). Under h (1/mm) click the drop down. Select 5.5e-4 (calf). Click Next. The Light Source to Optode Mapping window will now be open. Leave all settings as is and click Next. The Device settings window will now be open. Leave all settings as is and click Next. The Further Options window will now be open. The Action drop down should have Start measurement after finishing wizard selected. Click Finish. The Create All Graphs window will pop up. Leave settings as is and click OK. There will be an Oxysoft pop up. It says ‘The program will enable the light sources now. Are you sure you want to start the device(s)?’ DO NOT click yes yet. Wait until device has been placed correctly. Follow the steps described in A.7. A.7 Placement on Vastus Lateralis The PortaMon can measure up to 2 centimeters depth into tissue. Since we are interested in muscle oxygenation, the muscle belly has to be within 2 centimeters from the surface of the skin. Otherwise, the device is not measuring muscle oxygenation but adipose tissue oxygenation. Therefore, we use an ultrasound to measure the subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness. Place the device over the location measured by ultrasound. 2.Connect the NIRS by following the steps under A.6. Click ‘yes’ to enable light sources and begin data collection. Wait approximately 10 seconds. In the DAQ Values panel, click on the Raw Values drop down and select Percentages. Check the DAQ values. There are 6 boxes for DAQ values; one for each wavelength of light emitted by each transmitter. If the DAQ percentage is greater than 92%, the box with the DAQ percentage displayed will turn red. Try to make small adjustments to the device placement on the leg to bring the DAQ values down as needed. If the L6 (Tx3 856nm) box stays red with a value of 98% the whole time, it is likely you will not be able to make any adjustment to bring the DAQ percentage down. Mark that Tx3 was red the whole time on the data collection sheet. Try to bring all percentages below 70% if possible. DAQ percentages will increase during cycling and we want to have enough buffer to allow the percentages to increase without reaching red values. Generally, percentages below 70% at rest will likely be sufficient to allow for the movement increases. If the small adjustments add up to a large difference from the original ultrasound measurement location, re-measure adipose tissue thickness using the ultrasound in the new location. When all three DAQ values remain white when the subject moves around their leg, then the device is in the best location. If one of the DAQ values turns red during movement, that can be okay but only ONE. If two of the DAQ values are red, then TSI cannot be calculated so we do our best to have at least two good signals, three if at all possible. Tape the device in place. Rock the device laterally and remove the tape cover on the exposed side. Rock the device back into place and stick the tape to the subject’s skin. Repeat on the other side. Double check that the DAQ values remain consistent. Take a picture of the device placement on the leg. Use a measuring tape to show the distance from the top of the kneecap to the bottom of the device and use a perpendicular measuring tape to show the distance from the center of the thigh to the right edge of the device. Print the picture and place in the participant’s physical file. Upload a .png of the picture into the RedCap. Tape the device in place. Use the non-latex tape to securely tape the device to the skin. We do this after the picture so that the extra tape over the top of the device is not shown in the picture. Use about 6 inches of tape. Place the center of the tape over the top of the device. Use your fingers to stick the tape to the sides of the device. Once the tape is secured across the top of the device and on the sides, stick the rest of the tape to the participant’s skin. Repeat across the bottom of the device. A.8 During Data Collection When the device is placed correctly, click yes. The new measurement will begin. When you are done with the measurement, click the red pill in the top bar to stop the light sources. Oxysoft will stop the rolling every 30 seconds view and you will be able to see the whole measurement in the panes. A.9 Save Measurement Save the project file. Click File and Save Project File The project file must be saved with the new measurements before closing Oxysoft or turning off the computer. Otherwise, the project file will not have the new measurement when Oxysoft is reopened. Save a copy of the .oxy4 file in the patient’s folder on the desktop. Note: this copy of the .oxy4 file should be the data as it was collected. Even if Tx3 was bad quality and should be removed from TSI calculations, make sure to save this copy with the optode-template TSIFF and without any filters or calculations. If the oxy4 file is uploaded with the TSI optode-template or filters, there is no way to restore the data to the rawest form or apply a different filter. Filters can always be applied later, and the measurement properties can also always be applied later. Open the Windows file manager. Open the NIRS Data folder. Find the new .oxy4 file created for this measurement. Copy the file. Open the patient’s data folder. Put the copied file in the patient’s data folder. If necessary, rename the file to match the rest of the files in the folder. Save a copy of the .oxy4 file in the patient’s folder in RedCap. Open RedCap. Go to the File Repository. In the OXYSOFT folder, open the OXY4 Files folder. In the appropriate patient’s folder, upload the file that was just saved in the patient’s folder on the desktop. A.10 Change Measurement Properties Right click on the name of the measurement in the Project panel on the left. Select Properties.... This will open up a new panel. Leave the measurement name and data file as is. Click Next. Under Optode -template: select PortaMon TSI instead of PortaMon TSI Fit Factor. Change the settings as follows: Under d (mm) type 32.5. Under delta d (mm) type 5. Ensure k (1/mm) is 1.63 (calf). and h (1/mm) is 5e-4 (calf). Click Next. When Tx3 has been removed from the TSI calculations, the graph panels will look different. The Rx1-Tx3 panel will have two flat lines, one blue and one red. The TSIFF panel will still have a green line for TSI, and will no longer have a TSIFF line in that panel. To undo these changes and revert to the original measurement with Tx3 included in the TSI calculations, right click on the file name and open up the Properties panel again. Click Next. Next to the Optode-template settings table, there is a button on the bottom right that says Restore. Click Restore. Click Next. The graphs are now restored to their original state. A.11 Data Export A.11.1 Options There are many ways to export a measurement from Oxysoft. See section 4.4.4 of the Oxysoft manual for full details. I will briefly go over my preferences for export. First, I do not work in MatLab. If you are a MatLab user, you can look in the manual for information about preferred export options for MatLab users. Second, I do not like Excel files for these datasets. The number of rows exceeds 9,600 just for the data during the testing, not including the calibration time before testing begins. Excel starts to lag with files that long. The header on Excel files can make them difficult to read into other software later on. I have come to prefer exporting our data as text files. I have written file readers in R and in Python for exported text files. There are three data transform options for exporting data. Graph data of open graphs (non-cyclic only) This exports the data that is currently viewable in the open graph panels. If you have zoomed in, only the data that is visible will be exported. If you have applied filters to the data, the filtered data is what will be exported. This allows you to apply filters in Oxysoft, see the result, then export your filtered data. If you have closed one of the graphs, the data that was in that graph will not be exported. Only the open graph panels will get their data exported. If you have more than one measurement open, all graphs will be exported. There will be one column in the data for each trace in each measurement, but the file header will only contain the measurement information for the measurement that was selected for export. Multiple open measurements will create a wider data set than expected. Template OD values and ADC voltage This exports the optical densities measured by the device. It only exports data using the template. For example, if the measurement properties have been changed to remove Tx3 from the optode-template and use TSI rather than TSIFF optode-template, the exported data will have columns for Tx1and Tx2. If the optode-template is TSIFF, the exported data will have columns for Tx1, Tx2, and Tx3. OD values and ADC voltage This also exports the optical densities measured by the device. It exports all data, regardless of presence in the optode-template. If the TSI optode-template has been used, all three channels wil be exported regardless of use in the optode-template. Optical densities can be useful when examining data quality. I have created a file reader in Python that can work with the optical density files. The file reader works with existing NIRS processing packages which can convert the optical densities to haemoglobin using the modified Beer-Lambert law. A.11.2 Steps Open the appropriate measurement graphs. Make sure there is only one measurement open when you go to export the measurement. Close all open graphs. For any open measurements, select the name of the measurement that is open in the Project panel on the left. Right click on the name of the measurement and click Close all graphs. Repeat as needed for all open measurements. When there are no open graphs in the panels, select the name of the measurement. Right click and select Open all graphs. There should be four panels open, one titled Tx1-Rx1, Tx2-Rx1, Tx3-Rx1, and one TSIFF. Select optode-template. Check notes on the data collection sheet. If Tx3 was marked as white for the duration of data collection, proceed to step 3. If Tx3 was marked as red for the duration of data collection, follow the steps in A.10 to change the optode-template to TSI. Apply filters. Export. Select Export measurement under the Measurement dropdown. A new panel will open. Select the type of file you wish to export as. The automatic selection is text (.txt), which is the preferred type of export. Click Next. A new popup will prompt you to choose a location for the exported file. Click Browse. There is a folder on the desktop for all data for the NIRS study. Select that folder as the destination. In the file name bar, type in the name of the measurement. I prefer for the exported file and the name of the measurement in Oxysoft to match for consistency. When you type in the name of the measurement in oxysoft, it will prompt you to select nameofthefile.oxy4. Do not select this. Just type the name of the measurement with no file extension. Click Save. The file path should be to the NIRS data folder and should be named the same as the measurement with a .txt extension. Click Next. The Export Options popup will have several selections for the type of data to export. Leave the default selection, Graph data of open graphs. Click Next. The Export Time Span pop up will have the option to remove data from the beginning or end of the measurement. Leave the time span as it is and export the full measurement. Click Start Export.

Get a new purple filter from the box of filters by the window to the right of the TV. Pull the filter out of the packaging and throw away the plastic bag and extra gray tube in the package. Get the following pieces from the baskets on the top of the black cabinet behind the lab door: Spit tube White connector piece for the spit tube Gray rubber adapter Screw the spit tube into the white connector piece. If the spit tube refuses to screw in, try the other spit tube. One of them has damaged screw threads and will be difficult. Put the short end of the filter into the pneumotach side of the mixing chamber on the second shelf of the PARVO computer cart. Put the end of the adapter that has spirals around the inside on the long end of the purple filter sticking out of the pneumotach side of the mixing chamber. Connect one end of the white connector piece to the end of the gray rubber adapter that is smooth on the inside. Get a long piece of clear tubing from the back of the black cabinet behind the door of the lab. Connect one end of the tubing to the white connector piece with the spit tube. Hang the other end of the tubing from the adjustable arm on the PARVO computer cart. B.2.1 Calibration In order to conduct calibration, the cart must have been powered on for at least 30 minutes. Ensure the filter and other pieces are connected to the gas analyzer as shown above. B.2.1.1 Gas Calibration Select Gas Calibration from the software home screen. Enter room temperature (Celcius), barometric pressure (mmHg), and room humidity (%) from the Davis Vantage Vue on Sara Biddle’s desk. Click OK. When prompted, turn on the sample gas. find the sample gas (gas container on the bottom left of the cart) rotate the black handle on top of the gas container counter-clockwise until you cannot turn it anymore. Do not turn the black knob that is taped in place. Click OK. The computer will go through several countdown screens. Wait until the prompt to turn off the gas comes up. Rotate the black handle on top of the gas container clockwise as far as you can to the “OFF” position. Click ‘OK’ to see calibration results. DO NOT SAVE results if the percentage is greater than 1%. This means that this calibration differs from the last calibration by more than we want. If you save the results, since it is a percentage change from the last calibration, the next calibration will have to decrease by greater than 1%. Example: First calibration attempt results in a percentage of 1.5%. In order to be within 1% of the attempt prior to the first attempt, the second calibration attempt will need to result in a percentage of -0.5%. To save us from doing this math in between calibration attempts, just do not save attempts greater than 1% difference. If results are greater than 1%, try the following steps: open the lab door turn on the fans to blow air around the room wait at least 10 minutes and attempt calibration again When the gas calibration results in less than 1% change from the previous calibration, save results and exit to the home screen. If you have tried all of the steps above and the gas calibration still results in greater than 1% change from the previous calibration and you are out of time, save the gas calibration results. After the participant leaves, you can try to redo the gas calibration to get back under the 1% change from the previous calibration. There are several reasons that the calibration will still result in a difference greater than 1%, such as the weather, issues with the air conditioning, and more. The only things we can do to prevent issues with the calibration is limit the number of people in the lab. Have extra people stand out in the hallway or try to schedule fewer people to come in to the lab. B.2.1.2 Flowmeter Calibration The flowmeter calibration consists of three phases. The first phase is the Detection phase. This is one flush of the syringe for the software to ensure that the flushes are detected at all. The second phase is the Flushes phase. This is four flushes of the calibration syringe. These can be practice flushes for the calibration flushes. The speed of the flushes does not matter and these flushes are not saved as part of the calibration. The third phase is the Strokes phase. This is five flushes of the calibration syringe. The flushes must each be a certain speed. It is generally easiest to start with the slower speeds and increase with each flush. At the end of a flush, a line of white dots will come across the screen at the maximum value of the flush. When you successfully match the flush speed, the blue bar corresponding to that flush speed will disappear. \\TODO finish flowmeter calibration description of steps and flushes. Connect tubing to the calibration syringe. The purple filter and the spit tube should already be placed on the end of the gas mixing chamber on the second shelf of the PARVO computer cart. Connect one end of the tubing on the end of the spit tube adapter piece. Get the calibration syringe from the third shelf of the PARVO computer cart and put it on the top of the desk for easier use. Get the syringe adapter from the third shelf of the PARVO computer cart. This piece will resemble parts of the mask that we prepare for participant’s to wear. It is slightly different, as instead of the semi-transparent circle piece that the blue rubber mask is connected to, there is a white circle piece. Connect the clear end of the syringe mask adapter to the other end of the tubing. Connect the white end of the syringe mask adapter to the rubber on the end of the syringe. Select ‘Flowmeter Calibration’ from the software home page. Check the atmospheric variables. If the gas calibration was completed prior to the flowmeter calibration, the atmospheric variables should be the same as what you entered for the gas calibration. If the gas calibration was not completed prior to the flowmeter calibration, go back and do the gas calibration first. Check the room temperature (Celcius),room humidity (%), and barometric pressure (mmHg) inputs match the Davis Vantage Vue on Sara Biddle’s desk. If the atmospheric variables match the vantage vue, click Sample Baseline. The Flowmeter Calibration will start. Detection Phase Flushes Phase Strokes Phase After the fifth successful stroke, the software will immediately display the calibration results. Check that the percent difference is less than 1%. If the absolute value of the percent difference is less than 1, click Save. If the absolute value of the percent difference is greater than one, click Cancel and try the flowmeter calibration again a few minutes later. B.2.2 Mask Sizing Find the mask size guide in the caddy that sits on the wheeled cart that sits next to the ultrasound. Hold the mask size guide up to the face of the patient. Hold the top of the guide at the bridge of the nose. Look at the bottom of the guide and see where the chin sits. Choose the appropriate size. If the chin rests between two sizes, try the smaller size first. B.2.3 Mask Assembly Pink buckets and mask parts are sterile and should NOT be touched without gloves. There are several boxes of latex gloves in different sizes in the lab. Pick whichever size fits you before touching ANY parts. Grab a pink bucket and ensure the following components are in the bucket: Clear plastic with two black circles Clear plastic with triangle White plastic that narrows Semi-transparent circle made of hard plastic Two hard plastic white circles Two silicone caps Take a silicone cap and place on a hard plastic white circle The silicone cap and the hard plastic white circle should face the same direction (the outer rims should be on the same side) Carefully pull the outer rim of the silicone cap over the lip of the hard white plastic circle. Be careful not to tear the silicone, handle these pieces very gently! Rotate the hard white plastic circle to make sure that the outer rim of the silicone cap is pulled over the lip all the way around. You should be able to gently push through the middle of the hard white plastic circle and stretch the top of the silicone cap out from the edge of the hard white plastic circle while the outer rim of the silicone cap stays in place over the lip of the hard white plastic circle. Repeat with the other silicone cap and hard plastic white circle. There should be two pairs of silicone cap and hard plastic white circle. Take one of the pairs of silicone cap and hard plastic white circle and the clear tapered hard plastic piece. Place the silicone cap into the larger end of the clear tapered piece. The outer rim of the silicone cap should sit flush with the rim of the clear tapered piece. The silicone should face the inside of the clear tapered piece. Take the middle piece of the mask (the clear cylindrical piece with three openings and two black cylinders on it) and rotate it around until you can see the arrows etched into it. The arrows etched into the piece show the direction of air flow through the pieces. The air comes “in” from one opening, into and out of the mask where someone is breathing in and out of one opening, and “out” of one opening into the tubing and finally into the gas analyzer. The silicone pieces allow air to flow in only one direction so that all air the person breathes out is sent into the gas analyzer. Find the arrow pointing “out” of the cylinder and rotate it so that the arrow pointing “out” points to your right. Take the clear tapered piece with the silicone vent inside it and screw it onto the opening facing the right Take the second silicone vent and place it in the left opening of the middle piece. This opening should be directly opposite the opening facing to the right of the middle piece, that now has the clear tapered piece screwed on. The silicone vent should have the outer rim flush with the outer rim of the opening, and the silicone should face into the middle piece. Take the white tapered plastic piece and screw on to the opening over the silicone vent. Take the semi-transparent hard plastic circle and screw onto the remaining opening of the middle piece. Select the blue rubber mask of the appropriate size. The size is etched on the “chin” of the mask. See B.2.2 for choosing the correct size. Orient the blue mask as if you were going to wear it on your face. The “nose” should be upward with the “chin” downward and the hard clear plastic pieces should face outward. You should only see blue rubber. Orient the assembled pieces so that the air flows in the appropriate direction. The “out” arrow direction with the clear tapered end should point towards the station with the gas analyzer, i.e. if the gas analyzer will be on the left then the clear tapered end should point to the left, and if the gas analyzer will be on the right then the clear tapered end should point to the right. In the HPL, the stationary exercise bike will always have the gas analyzer on the left, therefore have the clear tapered end point to the left. The third opening with the semi-transparent circular piece should face the “mouth” of the blue rubber mask. Stretch the opening of the blue rubber mask over the semi-transparent circle opening of the assembled pieces. This is difficult and you will have to manhandle the blue rubber mask a bit. It does not stretch super well. Look through the mask and make sure that there is a good seal around the opening. If there is not a good seal, the blue rubber will not make a perfect circle around the opening. B.2.4 Heart Rate Monitor All men leave the room (except family the patient may or may not have brought with them to the lab). Spray water on the part of the monitor that will be in contact with the skin. Have the patient hold the center ‘button’ on the strap to their sternum. Clip the ends of the strap together. Tighten the strap to be snug around the patient’s chest. Push the strap up under the patient’s bra strap and make sure the monitor is in contact with the skin all the way across the chest. Use the watch to check that the monitor is sending a good signal. Press the middle button to the left of the watch face and wait to see the watch display a heart rate. If the heart rate does not display or shows a number that seems off, try to adjust the monitor to get a better connection. Try to push the monitor up higher on the sternum. This can be difficult on some patients depending on breast tissue, so do your best. Check the signal again. If the watch is having issues connecting with the heart rate monitor, you can check from the Parvo software. add steps here B.3 Data Collection Select VO2/Metabolic Testing. Enter the patient’s study ID number as the last name. Enter the testing ID as the first name. The testing ID for lactate thresholds is “LT”. The testing ID for On/Off Kinetics is “FP_CYCLE#”. Enter the following as BOTH the first and last name: Enter the participant’s height, weight, and age. Check that the atmospheric variables match the Vantage Vue on the desk. Check that the selected value under Test Degree is Submaximal, that Excercise Device is Bike, and Heart Rate/ECG is Active. Click OK. Select the testing protocol. Lactate Threshold Test Under Protocol Selection, make sure NIRS Lactate Protocol is selected. Input appropriate wattage jumps as decided by the study staff. On/Off Kinetics Test Under Protocol Selection, make sure that NIRS Exercise Protocol is selected. Input the appropriate wattage for work stages, as determined after lactate threshold testing. Click OK and wait for the software to start the test. When testing is complete, click ‘end test’. Save results and print a copy of the report. Check that the report will be printed with 10-second averages. Click ‘config’ in the bottom left and ensure that the data averaging selected is 10 seconds. Click ‘OK’ and print. The report will be printed on the printer on the bottom shelf of the cart. B.4 After Data Collection B.4.1 Data Export The ParvoMedics software can export the data as Excel files or XML. The Excel files it creates use an old version of Excel, the 97-2003 version. If you try to open this file on an up to date computer, your computer will think you are trying to kill it with a virus. To open the Excel files, you will need to re-save it as an updated Excel file. The XML files do not need to be opened and re-saved as up-to-date files, however they are more difficult to work with than Excel files. Export each dataset as both XML and Excel. That way, the person doing data analysis can choose the file format they prefer without having to go back and export all the files again. Save exported files to a USB drive. The PARVO computer is not connected to the internet so the files cannot be directly uploaded to RedCap and must first be transferred to a computer with an internet connection. Make sure to use the Windows prompt to safely eject the USB drive. Many newer computers have some sort of auto setting to safely eject hardware, but this computer is old and has not been updated in some time. Always eject safely to protect the computer and the data on the hard drive. From the home screen, select Reports. Select the measurement you want to export. Click Text Report. Check that the text report header has the correct information for the patient. If the information is correct, proceed to step 5. If the information is incorrect, proceed through the next steps. Close the text report. Click Edit Info. Change the information that needs to be corrected. Save the changes. Click Config. By Data Averaging, select Single Breath from the drop down. Click OK. If the single breath averaging was applied correctly, the TIME column in the data will show one row for each breath. The time between breaths will vary, but will generally be less than five seconds. Click XML Export. The software automatically chooses a name for the file using the first and last name and the date of the testing. Re-name it to something easier to read using the usual pattern. Select an appropriate location to save the file. Normally in a USB drive. Click Save. Close open panels. Safely eject the USB drive. Click on the icon in the bottom right of the screen. Click safely eject hardware. When it is safe, pull out the USB drive. B.4.2 Cleaning Equipment Put on a pair of gloves. Everything that has touched the patient’s skin will need to be cleaned. Place everything that needs to be cleaned into a pink bucket. This includes the mask, the mask straps, the clear tubing, the spit catcher, and the heart rate monitor strap. Take apart the mask into its individual pieces. Take the button off the heart rate monitor strap and wipe the button down with an alcohol wipe. On the blue cart in the corner behind the door, there is a white bucket with a lid. Take this cart with the pink bucket. When you walk through the hallways of the hospital, you can NOT wear gloves. Take off your gloves and put a clean pair in a pocket to bring with you just in case. Take the cart with the pink bucket of dirty equipment and walk to the service room. In the service room, take the pieces of the mask, disassembled, and the mask strap and the heart rate monitor strap and place them all in the blue liquid in the white bucket. Ensure the blue liquid covers all the pieces. Start a timer for 12 minutes. Leave everything soaking for 12 minutes. Make sure to put the lid on the bucket while it soaks, as the blue liquid is light sensitive. While everything is soaking, pump soap and water into the clear tubing. Swish the soapy water around the tubing, making sure to get every part of the tubing. Do this over the sink or you will spill water out of the ends of the tubing. Rinse the tubing out and get out all of the soapy water. Use soap and water to clean out the bottom of the pink bucket. It had dirty equipment in it and it needs to be cleaned before you put clean equipment back in it. At the end of the 12 minutes, pull all the parts out of the blue liquid and rinse them off in the sink. Put them in the pink bucket. Close the bucket of blue liquid. Walk the blue cart back to the lab. Take all the equipment and set it out to dry behind the door.

The final score is the mean of the 9 measure items and can range from 0-10. A score can be calculated if at least 5 items out of 9 are answered by taking the mean of the completed items. C.2 Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire Godin and Shephard made the Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (LTEQ) in 1985.3 The LTEQ was originally a two item survey: “Item 1 consists of 3 parts, in which participants note how often per week they do strenuous, moderate, and mild exercise. Item 2 asks participants to note how often they engage in an activity long enough to work up a sweat.“ This was used to group people into several different categories of activity levels. In 2011, Godin published the Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GLTPAQ).4 This removed the second item and was used to group respondents into 2 categories, “insufficiently active” and “active” based on the ACSM guidelines for weekly moderate and strenuous physical activity levels. The form that we use says Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire across the top of the form, by the Oncology Nursing Society. At the bottom left, it says ‘adapted from: Godin, G. (2011). The Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. Health &amp; Fitness Journal of Canada, 4(1), 18-22.’ I don’t know why that’s the title they chose to put on the top of the form, it’s made things more confusing than it needs to be. I have so far been unable to find the original paper that uses this form. C.3 Mini-Mental State Examination The Mini-Mental State Examination is a cognitive screening tool. We use it to screen for cognitive impairment before patients can participate in this study. Patients must score greater than 27 to continue with the study. C.4 Physical Activity History The Physical Activity History is intended to capture the physical activity history of the respondent using the FITVVP principles. There are two physical activity history forms: Intake and Follow Up. The Physical Activity History: Intake form asks the patient to describe their normal physical activities. It consists of 5 items. Item 1 asks if the respondent participates in moderate to vigorous physical activity. If the respondent answers yes, there are spaces to describe the physical activity below. Item 2 asks the respondent if this describes their physical activity from the past 5 years. If not, the respondent can describe how their physical activity habits have changed over the past 5 years. Item 3 asks if the respondent participates in interval training. If the respondent answers yes, there are spaces to describe the training. Items 4 and 5 ask about participation in recreational sports and whether the respondent has had any injuries that would contradict participation in exercise. The Physical Activity History: FollowUp asks the respondent to describe their physical activities since the last time they answered the Physical Activity History survey. This form does not ask about physical history prior to the most recent visit visit. C.5 PROMIS Global Health v1.1 We use the PROMIS Global Health v1.1 form. This is a discontinued PROMIS measure. Follow the scoring guidelines to convert the v1.1 questions and answers into v1.2. The scoring guidelines have been uploaded into the RedCap file repository and the RedCap instrument follows those guidelines.

Locate the vastus lateralis. Find the ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) by asking the participant to place their hands on their hips and feeling for the bony protrusion at the front of the hip. Measure from the top of the kneecap to the ASIS. Locate the vastus lateralis by moving superior to the kneecap on-third of the distance from the kneecap to the ASIS. Use the ultrasound gel to cover the wand. Place the wand over the pre-determined location of the vastus lateralis. Move around the wand until you find the location of the thinnest section of adipose tissue. Ensure that this is still over the vastus lateralis by marking the location with a marker, then removing the wand and asking the patient to extend their leg and flex their quadriceps muscles. If the dot is not on top of the vastus lateralis when the patient extends their leg, try again. If the dot is over the vastus lateralis, place the wand back over the dot. Freeze the screen. Press the ‘caliper’ button to use calipers on the frozen screen. Move one end of the caliper to the top of the screen. Move the other end of the caliper to the area of the screen that looks like the boundary between the muscle belly and the edge of the adipose tissue. This will be a silvery line across the screen. Try to make the caliper measurement as vertical as possible, as a diagonal measurement will be larger than a straight one. Record the measurement given by the caliper. D.2 Lactate Meter D.2.1 Usage D.2.1.1 Quality Control Testing Before using the lactate meters, you must conduct a quality control test. Get out the ‘Blood Lactate Meter’ binder from Frankie Bennet’s desk. Open the binder to the quality control log. Record the date. Look on the bottle of lactate strips and find the lot number. Record the lot number in the appropriate space. Look on the low control bottle (blue dropper). Record the expected range for this bottle. Record the lot number and expiration date. Look on the high control bottle (red dropper). Record the expected range for this bottle. Record the lot number and expiration date. Turn on the lactate meter by pressing the center triangle-shaped button. Use the button to click through the screens until you reach the control screen. which has a star in the upper left corner and says ‘CRL-1’. Put a lactate strip in the lactate meter. The white end should stick out from the meter and the metal end should go in the meter. Use the red control dropper to place a drop on the lactate strip. Wait for the lactate meter to give results (about 15 seconds). Record the results in the binder. Discard the used lactate strip in the trash and do another test with the red control with a new lactate strip. If you get an error, you probably did not use enough liquid. Make sure the drops are of a size to completely soak the tip of the lactate strip. Repeat with the blue control dropper. Make sure results are recorded correctly in the log. D.2.1.2 Data Collection Use the center triangle-shaped button to click through the screens and choose any profile that is not a control profile. Place a lactate strip in the top of the meter. You are ready for data collection. "],["ExerciseTesting.html", "E Exercise Testing E.1 Administering Exercise Testing E.2 Lactate Threshold Exercise Test E.3 On/Off Kinetics Exercise Test", " E Exercise Testing There are two types of exercise tests. The lactate threshold test is conducted to determine what power output (wattage) is associated with a rise in lactate production. For the general population, lactate threshold is considered to be 4.0 mMoL/L. The On/Off Kinetics test is conducted to measure the patient’s mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The transition from work to rest allows the NIRS device to capture the magnitude and rate of oxygen recovery after exercise. The power output of the exercise is 110% of the power output at lactate threshold. We use this power output in order to ensure that the exercise is difficult enough to produce a change in oxygen levels during exercise. E.1 Administering Exercise Testing We split up the work of administering the exercise test into three jobs: RPE For lactate threshold testing, the person doing RPE is the person taking the lactate measurements. For On/Off Kinetics testing, the person in charge of RPE tends to be the person who is in contact with the patient the most. With thirty seconds left in every stage of testing (both lactate threshold testing and on/off kinetics testing), they will hold up the clipboard with the RPE scale and say the following: “What is the first number that comes to mind?”. Say those exact words. The patient will then say or point to the number that corresponds to how they are feeling. This person is also in charge of watching the patient on the bike and checking in to see how they feel. If the exercise becomes too difficult or the patient does not feel well, they are in charge of communicating with the rest of the team to end the test early and get the patient off the bike. NIRS Watch the NIRS computer as it is collecting data. Take note of any times when the signal from the NIRS is corrupted or when the patient is moving around during a rest. Record the time on the NIRS computer and note what was going on, i.e. if the DAQ for Tx3 was red or if the patient was moving. During the on/off kinetics test, this person also helps the patient put their foot on the box. The NIRS device is always placed on the right leg, so the left leg of the patient goes on the box. The left leg needs to go on the box during a rest section to help the patient stay perfectly still. If both feet are left in the stirrups of the bike, the patient will tend to rock their feet back and forth to stay balanced on the bike. This causes movement in the NIRS data that we do not want. We choose to put the left leg on the box rather than the right leg because if the right leg is placed on the box like that, then the patient will be tensing their right quadriceps muscles. This would mean that we are not getting a true rest measurement of the vastus lateralis. Therefore, we put the left foot on a box and allow the right leg to dangle at complete rest in the stirrups of the bike. With fifteen seconds left in a work section before a rest, kneel down by the box and get ready. The Parvo person will give you a countdown to the end of the stage and when it hits 0 and the patient stops pedaling, pull their left foot out of the stirrup and place their heel on the box. Remind the patient to stay completely still. During a rest period, they are more likely to want to talk to fill the silence and if you make them laugh too hard, the NIRS data will be effected. Try to keep them still and focused on the resting. This is especially true for the last rest section, as they are done with the exercise which is the “hard part”. PARVO Check during the initial rest on the bike that the Parvo is collecting valid data. At rest, VO2 should be between 3-5. If VO2 is lower than 3, check that the mask is forming a good seal around the patient’s face. If the seal is good and the VO2 is still below 3, ask the patient to sit up straight and take normal breaths. Some people hunch over on the bike which decreases the volume of air that they breath in and out. Some people hold their breath a little bit when you put the mask on because it can feel a little claustrophobic. Remind them that the mask is not limiting their breathing, it is just measuring what they are breathing. Tell them that the system we use is the same one they use at NASA and the Olympic Training Centers. This tends to help people feel better. The Parvo shows the RPM of the bike. If the RPM drops below 60, encourage the patient to get the RPM back up above 60. If the RPM are higher than 110, remind the patient that they do not need to work that hard and try to drop the RPM below 90. For each stage, record the VO_2_, Heart Rate (bpm), and RPE. For a lactate threshold test, record the lactate measurements when the person taking the lactates yells them out. The VO2 and Heart Rate will be on the Parvo screen. There is a real time heart rate number and a fifteen second average number. The real time number is smaller and will be blinking in time with the heart rate. The fifteen second average number will be in one of the blue boxes in the top left. The fifteen second average numbers refresh every fifteen seconds. If the stage is three minutes long, you will wait until two minutes and fourty five seconds of the stage have passed and the final refresh has happened for that stage to record the VO2 and heart rate. For each stage, tell the patient when a stage is starting, when they are halfway done with the stage, when there is 30 seconds left in a stage, and give a countdown to the next stage. This would result in the following statements during one stage: “The stage has begun. You are halfway done with this stage. Thirty seconds left in this stage. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.” If this is a lactate threshold test, you can make a comment about how this next stage should be slightly more difficult or how they should feel a change in the wattage. If this is an on/off kinetics test, they can tell the patient what the next stage will be, i.e. work or rest. During a work stage, this could sound something like: “Two minutes of exercise starting now. You’re halfway to a rest. Thirty seconds left until rest.” All of these statements also help the other staff to do their jobs. The thirty second mark tells the RPE person to get an RPE measurement and the countdown allows the NIRS person to get ready to do the box. There are two places to look for the time on the Parvo. There is a total elapsed time and there is a time left in this stage. The time left in the stage is the easiest to look at for keeping track of timing. E.2 Lactate Threshold Exercise Test E.2.1 Specifications The lactate threshold test is completed on a cycle ergometer. Ventilatory measurements are collected breath by breath via metabolic cart. Lactate is measured via finger prick. Prior to beginning exercise testing, measure resting blood lactate. This should be less than 2.0 mmoL/L in order to begin testing. Normal resting blood lactate lies between 0.8-1.2 mmoL/L, however stress or nervousness prior to an exercise test can increase resting blood lactate levels. If lactate levels are slightly elevated but still lower than 2.0 mmol/L, then lactate may drop back down as the body uses lactate during warm up stages. The exercise test is conducted as follows: Begin with a two minute rest. The subject sits on the stationary bike without pedaling for two minutes. Each subsequent stage is three minutes in duration. The wattage increases by a consistent amount between each stage. During the last 30 seconds of each stage, blood lactate is measured via finger prick. Each lactate measurement is taken in pairs for duplicability. Lactate will increase as exercise difficulty increases. When the subject’s blood lactate exceeds 4.0 mmol/L, have the subject finish the next stage and then end the test. If the subject feels they cannot complete the next stage, end the test immediately. A blood lactate of 4.0 mmol/L should roughly correspond to a moderately difficult exercise intensity but should not be a maximal effort. E.2.2 Selecting Wattage Jumps Discuss the subject’s physical activity levels. If the subject doesn’t participate in much cardiorespiratory fitness activities, then start at a very low wattage (10 Watts) and make modest jumps (15 Watts). If the subject participates in long distance running, cycling, or swimming, then the subject may start at a higher wattage than less fit subjects and/or make larger jumps. When selecting wattage jumps, remember that lactate should increase exponentially as wattage increases linearly. Also, when conducting testing, there is no second chance to get the testing correct. It is better to use a very low starting wattage with modest increases as the initial settings, because if the subject is fitter than expected and their blood lactate levels remain stagnant, the wattage jumps can be increased during testing. Blood lactate will not go down in the time it takes to conduct the testing, and if the difficulty increases too quickly then the blood lactate levels will increase so quickly that it will be difficult to analyze the lactate curve. E.3 On/Off Kinetics Exercise Test E.3.1 Specifications The on/off kinetics test is completed on a cycle ergometer. Ventilatory measurements are collected breath by breath via metabolic cart (ParvoMedics OneTrue 2400, B). Muscle oxygenation measurements are collected via SR-NIRS (Artinis Medical Systems PortaMon, A) The exercise test consists of three square-wave transitions from exercise at 110% of wattage at lactate threshold to rest. Each stage of the test is two minutes long. Time Intensity 0-2 Baseline Rest 2-4 Warm Up (0 Watts) 4-6 Exercise Transition 6-8 Rest 1 8-10 Exercise Transition 10-12 Rest 2 12-14 Exercise Transition 14-16 Rest 3 "],["Appendix-DataAnalysis.html", "F Data Analysis F.1 Setting Up F.2 Resources", " F Data Analysis F.1 Setting Up F.1.1 The First Time Download R.

In the Time input, select the time. Use 24 hour format or the sliders that pop up when you click into the input box. If you are unsure of a time or the event is an all day event, do not put a time. If the date is scheduled but a time is not yet scheduled, type ‘Time TBD’ in the notes. This helps with remembering which events are yet to be completely scheduled. In the notes box, give the event a name. The first word or two will be visible on a Month view of the calendar. If the event is specific to a participant, do not put the participant ID number in the notes. Use the drop down below to associate the event with a Record ID. If this event is specific to a participant, use the drop down by Record ID to select the appropriate record ID for the participant. If not, do not select a record ID. When event information is completely filled in, click Add Event to Calendar at the bottom of the window. Check that the event is in the calendar with the correct date, time, and ID number. G.2.4.2 Infusions When a patient begins their treatment, put all tentative Day 1 of cycle dates into the calendar. Events can be deleted later if they are rescheduled. You do not need to put events in the calendar for other days of the cycle, since that would load the calendar with events that are not necessary for our scheduling purposes. Label the event as follows: Infusion Cycle N Day 1. Depending on the cycle length (two weeks, three weeks, one month), put one final event in the calendar that is the appropriate length after Day 1 of the final cycle. In the notes for this event, type something like “Post Final Cycle. Schedule last on/off kinetics around this date.” This will help us remember to schedule the final visits for patients. G.2.5 File Repository The RedCap File Respository can be found in the left panel in the Applications section. RedCap has no size limit on the amount of data that can be stored in the File Repository, unlike Google or Miscrosoft. Updated survey and data collection sheets are in the folder Surveys and Data Collection Sheets. In the Onboarding folder, there are copies of forms that new medical and undergraduate students must fill out to get IRB approval. In the IRB folder, there are copies of all forms that must be approved through IRB. This includes the consent form (English and Spanish versions), IRB protocol, and brochure. The OXYSOFT folder contains all NIRS data files. In the Oxy4 Files subdirectory, there is a subdirectory for each patient that we have gathered NIRS data for. Each patient’s individual .oxy4 files are in their respective folder. In the Exported Text Files subdirectory are all files exported from Oxysoft. The files are named according to the following conventions: For Lactate Threshold tests, NIRS_idnumber_LT_MM_DD_YYYY, with idnumber being a 3 digit number corresponding to the Record ID in RedCap with leading zeroes to fill extra digit space, “LT” for Lactate Threshold, and the date in “MM_DD_YYYY” format. For On/Off Kinetics tests, NIRS_idnumber_FP_MM_DD_YYYY_CYCLEN, with idnumber being a 3 digit number corresponding to the Record ID in RedCap with leading zeroes to fill extra digit space, “FP” for On/Off Kinetics (which were originally called Full Protocol tests), the date in “MM_DD_YYYY” format, and “N” being the current infusion cycle. The On/Off Kinetics test that takes place before the first infusion is named “CYCLE0”, the On/Off Kinetics test that takes place before the second infusion and after the first infusion is named “CYCLE1”, and so on. The PARVO folder contains all VO2 data files.

Send her their Prisma Health username, full name, and reason you want to give them access. The research study build allows you to associate patients with the research study with different statuses. H.2.1 Study Details The study code is 1853511 and the ID is PHU ITOR: NIRS. Dr. Larry Gluck is the principal investigator. Sara Biddle, Sydney Hackwell, Frankie Bennet, and Jim Rosenmeyer have research coordinator access to the study information. Click on the Research Studies tab of a patient’s chart to see all research study associations for the patient. There are several components of the Participant Details section of a study record. Status See H.2.2 for information about choosing an appropriate status. Status Effective Date When this status was applied. This will automatically choose today’s date. Change as necessary for retroactive status changes. Active Start Date Necessary for patients who are Active or Completed. This is the date they signed the consent form or the date of their first visit to the HPL. Active End Date Necessary for patients who are *Completed”. This is the date of their final visit to the HPL. Participant ID Necessary for any patient assigned an ID number. The auto-generated ID number assigned to the patient by RedCap. Must be filled in as soon as possible for the Biorepository to appropriately label blood draws. Patient Specific Coordinators Do not use. Comments Any information that other research coordinators should know. Used most frequently for Identified patients to note upcoming appointments and information about the treatment planning process, such as if the oncologists are waiting on any scans or lab results before completing the treatment plan. H.2.2 Study Statuses Dr. Martin has indicated that study statuses will be changing in the future to streamline the number of possible statuses. There are more statuses in Epic than will be discussed below, as not all statuses are applicable to this study. Follow up with Dr. Martin as needed about future changes to study statuses. There are three groups of study statuses. Pre-Consent Identified, Interested, Waiting for Consent Active Consented- In Screening, Active, Follow Up Inactive Ineligible, Declined, Completed, Disqualified, Withdrawn When the association is one of the Active statuses, a yellow Research Participant tag is displayed with the patient’s information. This lets other physicians see that the patient is participating in a research study. Use the study statuses as follows: Ineligible Patient with breast or primary gynecological cancer who does not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria based on a chart screen. Do not use this status for all patients who are not ineligible, such as a patient with lung cancer, as that would create unnecessary associations that will slow down any reporting. Use when patient will likely have more appointments in the department to prevent double screening in the future. Identified Patient may be eligible and will need to be followed up with. Use the comments section to make notes about when to follow up, such as upcoming appointments. Patients who have not been assigned a treatment plan are frequently assigned this status to monitor their chart for further appointments and treatment planning. Interested Patient was approached about the study and has not given a definitive answer about participation, neither to decline or sign a consent form. Declined Patient was approached about the study and declined to sign a consent form. Withdrawn Patient signed a consent form and subsequently decided to stop participation in the study. Active Patient is receiving active treatment and will be coming in to the HPL for visits. Completed Patient has completed the last of their visits to the HPL and has completed their final cycle of chemotherapy treatment.

Research studies you have access to will pop up. Click the appropriate study row. Status is required to save the association. Choose the appropriate status as defined in H.2.2. The Status Effective Date will automatically fill in today’s date. Change it by clicking into the box and selecting the date. Change other details as needed. Click Accept to save. H.2.4 Edit an Exisiting Association Open the patient’s chart in a chart review. Open the Research Studies tab in the top row. The patient’s study association should be displayed here. Click on the arrow by the name of the study. This opens up the study details. Click on the pencil icon by Participant Details to open up an editable view of the patient’s study details. Change any necessary details. Click Accept to save. H.3 Patient Charts After a patient consents, they will need to have two visits to the HPL before their first chemotherapy infusion. Under Chart Review, make sure that Hide upcoming/future is not checked. Look for an appointment with type Infusion. Click on the row to open the appointment information. Check the date, time, and location of the appointment in the panel that opens up on the right of the screen. Infusion appointments are not limited to chemotherapy. For example, if a patient gets a saline infusion for hydration, that will also show up as an Infusion. Cross reference Infusion appointments with the Treatment Plan dates to ensure that you are looking at a chemotherapy infusion. Chemotherapy infusions tend to be preceeded by a Lab appointment and Office Visit with a Nurse Practitioner or their Oncologist, although this is not always required. H.4 My Sticky Notes My Sticky Notes can be extremely useful. The sticky note will only be viewable by yourself, and will not display to anyone else who views the patient’s chart. When a patient’s chart is opened, look in the top left by the patient’s picture. If the yellow box that looks like a sticky note has nothing in it, you have not created a sticky note for that patient. If the sticky note has lines in it, then you have created a sticky note for that patient before. I have EPIC set to automatically open the sticky note whenever I open a patient’s chart that already has a sticky note. I like to use sticky notes to keep track of which patients I have already chart screened. In the schedule, I have EPIC set to display sticky notes in a column. If the sticky note has the lines in it, I know I have already looked at this patient’s chart and can open the sticky note to see what I have noted about the patient. I put the patient’s status as the first line of the note: Identified, Ineligible, Declined, etc. For Ineligible patients, I then put the reason the patient is not eligible. Generally, this is the treatment plan or an disqualifying medical condition. For treatment plans, I like to include the date the treatment plan started. For example, a patient is not eligible because they are actively receiving chemotherapy would have a note with the following content: Ineligible. started chemotherapy MM/DD/YYYY. I like to use sticky notes rather than the study association for these patients to keep reports from becoming cumbersome as the number of ineligible patients increases. For Identified patients, the content can vary depending on a variety of factors. I will put Identified on any patient that could possibly get chemotherapy, even if it is not likely, so that we continue to track the patient as their treatment is finalized. I like to include the diagnosis (breast or gyn cancer or mass) and any useful information for tracking the patient. If the patient is waiting on pathology results before the oncologist finalizes treatment plans, I like to include the date of the next appointment where the pathology will be reviewed. H.4.1 Treatment Plans To see the patient’s treatment plan, click on the name of their treatment plan in the right panel under ACTIVE TREATMENTS. This will open up the full Treatment Plan to the right. Treatment plans tend to be named with the following rules: DRUG QNW X M CYCLES Where N is the number of weeks each cycle lasts (i.e. 2, 3, or 4) and M is the number of cycles that the drug will be administered. If more than one drug is being adminstered at a time (which is very common), then the drugs that are administered together will appear in the name as follows: DRUG1 + DRUG2 QNW X M CYCLES If the treatment plan consists of two parts where some drugs are administered during the first part then different drugs are administered during the second part (i.e. switching from platinums to taxanes), then the treatment plan will be named like DRUG1 QLW X M CYCLES THEN DRUG2 QNW X P CYCLES where L is the number of weeks the cycle for the first drug lasts, M is the number of cycles that the first drug will be administered, N is the number of weeks the cycle for the second drug lasts, and P is the number of cycles the second drug will be administered. If the second drug does not have P CYCLES, then there will only be one cycle and the drug will be administered weekly for N weeks. Under the treatment plan, there is a drop down for each cycle. There will be further drop downs for each applicable day of the cycle. A basic treatment plan where the patient receives infusions every three weeks will only have Day 1 drop downs under each cycle. Other treatment plans may consist of multiple days. To see what is encompassed in the plan for each day, open up the drop down. If there is not a Chemotherapy tab under the Day, then the patient is not receiving any chemotherapy drugs that day. This may be the case if the patient gets labs before the come in for infusions or if they receive other types of infusions the day before a chemotherapy infusion, such as saline or steroids. H.5 Oncology Schedule In the top left of the screen, there is a tab for the schedule. The icon is a calendar. Open the schedule. Under My Schedule, you can create schedules that are applicable to you. Depending on what department you are logged in under, you will see the schedule for that department in a tab below the My Schedule tab.

I.2 Protocol I.2.1 Participants Participants recruited for this study will be breast cancer or gynecological cancer patients (N=40) who agree to participate in an exercise study examining the effects of chemotherapy on muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity, a measure of skeletal muscle health. A written informed consent will be obtained from the participants before data collection. This study has been submitted for review by the Institutional Review Board at the Prisma Office of Research Compliance and Administration (ORCA). We pledge to abide by all applicable institutional and governmental regulations regarding the ethical use of human volunteers for the duration of this research. This study focuses on breast cancer or gynecological cancer patients who will undergo a standard of care chemotherapy treatment as directed by their oncologist. Other eligibility requirements for this study are as follows: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer or gynecological cancer without distance metastasis Ages &gt; 20 years old Able to perform exercise on a stationary cycle ergometer at moderate intensities for a maximum of 15 minutes Hemoglobin values greater than 10 at baseline ALT and AST values less than 2.5X the upper limit of normal by institutional standards Godin-Shepard Leisuretime Physical Activity Questionnaire (GLTEQ) score of 14 or greater will be included. A score of less than 14 is considered insufficiency active/sedentary. The exclusion criteria include patients with: Clinically advanced cardiovascular disease Clinically advanced pulmonary disease Disease requiring continuous oxygen supplementation Greater than 2 centimeters or more of subcutaneous adipose tissue on the anterior thigh Inability to walk or stand Movement disorders Spinal cord injuries Autoimmune disorders Pregnant or breastfeeding Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Participants for this study will be recruited through informative pamphlets at the Center for Integrative Oncology Survivorship, Prisma Health System’s Cancer Institute at Greenville Memorial Hospital and affiliated physician offices. I.2.2 Experimental Design We will use an observational, 2-way, treatment x time, within-subjects research design to compare skeletal muscle oxidative capacity of the vastus lateralis muscle, during stationary cycling, across breast cancer or gynecological cancer patients at baseline and across their chemotherapy regimen. Muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity of the Vastus Lateralis muscle will be non-invasively evaluated using continuous wave, Near Infrared Resonance Spectroscopy (NIRS, PortaMon by Artinis Medical Systems BV in The Netherlands). I.2.3 Study protocol The NIRS participant testing will be performed in the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville’s Human Performance Laboratory located within Cancer Institute Faris Road facility. Testing will take approximately 30 minutes per session, with a maximum of 180 minutes of participation per patient. The independent variables in this study are drug regimen and number of chemotherapy treatments. The dependent variables in this study will be the change in oxygenation and deoxygenation status of the vastus lateralis as measured by the NIRS device, indicative of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, after a bout of cycling. Patients will be asked to avoid exercise and use of certain substances (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, and contraindicated medications) 24 hours prior to testing. The NIRS device consists of three LED transmitters that transmit light waves into muscle tissue and one high sensitivity PIN diode receiver, equipped with ambient light protection, which assesses light received from the transmitters. The three transmitters each emit light at two wavelengths. These wavelengths correspond to the absorption wavelengths of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin in the skeletal muscle tissue (approximately 760 nm and 850 nm). These wavelengths of light will be received from three separate transmitter distances (30mm, 35mm, and 40mm) at 10 Hz. The ΔO2Hb and Δ tissue saturation index (TSI%) will be calculated as the change from the last 30-s average of the work interval to the last 30-s average of the recovery interval. Oxygen uptake (VO2) will be obtained by using open-circuit spirometry (Parvo Medics, Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah). Cycling power will be determined via lactate threshold curves generated for each participant. Participants will be asked to perform exercise in shorts or equivalent. Participants will first sit at rest in a chair, as the NIRS device is applied to the vastus lateralis. The device will have double sided adhesive tape to lightly secure its position to the skin. The device will be wrapped in a black cloth to fully secure its position, limit device mobility, and block ambient light in the laboratory. Participants will then stand and walk to the cycle with the NIRS secured to the participant’s leg. Participants will sit on the bike for a 2-minute rest while wearing a fitted mask that comfortably measures the participant’s rate and amount of oxygen uptake (VO2) and other ventilatory measurements at rest and during exercise. I.2.3.1 Visit 1 Researchers will determine the participant’s lactate threshold curve and ventilatory threshold during a graded exercise test (Table 1). The lactate threshold is a measure of the rate at which capillary blood lactate measurements rise as an effect of increased exercise intensity. The blood lactate curve will be used to determine an individualized power wattage for subsequent exercise testing of “on-off kinetics” (see below description). Capillary blood lactate levels will be obtained by finger stick for point of care testing. Ventilatory threshold will be measured using indirect calorimetry via a metabolic cart that captures expired gasses (O2 and CO2) through a comfortable silicone mask worn by the participant. A baseline blood lactate level will be obtained at rest, then the participant will be instructed to cycle for three minutes beginning at 10W. After the 3-minute stage is complete, the power output will increase by 15 watts. The participant will cycle for 3 minutes at each stage until their lactate threshold reaches 4.0 mmol/L. Once the blood lactate reaches 4.0 mmol/L, one final, three-minute stage will be performed. A final lactate reading will be obtained at the completion of this exercise stage. The power output that is equivalent to 1.1x the wattage at which their lactate threshold exceeded 4.0 mmol/L will be used as the exercise intensity (“on-kinetics”) for subsequent visits accompanying chemotherapy treatments. I.2.3.2 Subsequent Visits Participants will return for each subsequent visit within a week before their next chemotherapy infusion as long as they are able to safely continue the exercise protocol (Table 2). The NIRS device will be secured to the participant’s leg similar to the first visit and the participants will put on the mask to measure ventilation. Participants will begin pedaling for a warmup at 0 watts for 2 minutes. After the two-minute warm up period is completed, the power output will increase to the previously calculated wattage of 1.1x LT. The participant will cycle at a self-selected cadence at this power wattage for a duration of 2 minutes (“on-kinetics”). At the end of each on-kinetics stage, participants will be asked to rate their level of effort during exercise, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). The participant will then stop pedaling and will remain in recovery, sitting on the bike for 2 minutes (“off-kinetics” stage). With 5 seconds remaining in the “off-kinetics” stage, the participant will start pedaling at the same self-selected cadence for their next “on-kinetics” stage, followed by another 2-min “off-kinetics” period. This cycle of exercise followed by rest, known as on-off kinetics, will repeat for a total maximum of 3 times, or until the participant reaches volitional fatigue. I.2.3.3 Collection of Surveys and Biometrics at Each Visit We will be administering MoCA, BFI, Physical Activity Intake, PROMIS Global Health, and GLTPAQ surveys prior to participant engagement in cycling exercises. We will also be administering BFI, PROMIS Global Health, and Physical Activity Follow-up surveys after each individual study session to assess changes in cancer related fatigue associated with chemotherapy treatment that may develop throughout the study time period. Patients will undergo routine, standard of care blood draws for a CBC and metabolic testing per their managing physician with an additional tube, during the same venipuncture, for a study covered aliquot for biomarkers related to mitochondrial health for correlative research. For biomarker analysis, exosomes from patient serum (approximately 250 uL samples) will be isolated using an ExoQuick ULTRA EV Isolation System (System Biosciences). Exosomes will then be detected with Western blotting with exosome specific antibodies. Exosome samples will be sent for RNASeq analysis of RNA within the isolated exosomes at System Biosciences. Bioinformatics analysis of the RNAs identified from the RNASeq will then be used to determine if there are specific RNAs present in patient blood associated with changes in mitochondrial function. In addition, selected mRNAs associated with mitochondrial function will be assessed (expression levels determined) with RT-qPCR using aliquots of the isolated serum exosomes. I.2.4 Statistical Analyses ANOVA one way with tukey post-hoc analysis to detect differences between drug regimen groups at each time point (baseline, all subsequent chemotherapy treatments) for time constant response and change in mitochondrial function for mitochondrial oxidative capacity. One-way ANOVAs will be used to additionally detect differences between different timepoints from baseline to final chemotherapy treatment for each individual chemotherapy regimen.

The NIRS measurements were taken twice, on separate days, for repeatability measurements. Participants also completed a step-incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer to exhaustion to determine FAT_max and LT, and a ramp incrememental test on a cycle ergometer to detemine VO_2max, GET, and RCP. All gas exchange measures were normalized by LBM (lean body mass). Adipose tissue over the NIRS measurement site was measured via ultrasound. NIRS data were corrected for blood volume changes.

You can also perform a sensitivity analysis, where power and sample size are held constant to determine the minimum effect size that would result in a significant result.

The NIRS probe (INVOS 5100C) was place on the ninth right rib in the midaxillary line and a second NIRS was used to monitor cerebral oxygenation. Two blood samples were drawn from the heaptic vein and compared with the simultaneous measurement by NIRS. The directly measured hepatic vein saturation was not correlated with the NIRS measured saturation. This may be due to the fact that hepatic blood flow is not well understood and some areas of the liver may receive no portal venous input. Also, ultrasound was not used to measure the depth of the liver from the skin surface. Since the probe was placed directly over the rib, the bone may have affected the measurement of liver blood flow. The researchers may have benefitted from using the HomER algorithm to correct for bone. Also, the paper does not well elucidate which NIRS signal they use when they refer to rSO_2-H. The researchers chose a line graph with dual lines for portal vein saturation and NIRS measured saturation when a scatterplot demonstrating a lack of correlation would have been more appropriate. The researchers may have benefitted from using an ultrasound to determine the depth of the liver with respect to the NIRS probe in order to determine whether the signal truly reached the depth of the liver tissue. .

This article breaks down factors into several categories : Environmental, Instrumentation, Mechanical, Population, Physiological, and Study Design/Data Analysis. Environmental factors include ambient light. Solutions include covering the optodes with something opaque. Optode calibration, an Instrumentation factor, can be conducted using algorithms, or for coninuous-wave systems, a simple normalization. This article recommends turning the LEDs on at least 30 minutes prior to data aquisition to allow for appropriate heating. Saturation effects and strategies to detect and remove them are discussed in section 4.4 on page 5. It is recommended to remove instrumental noise before using the Modified-Beer Lambert Law to convert optical densities into haemodynamic data. Abrupt movement may disturb optode-skin coupling which is shown in data as a large sudden change in chromophore concentration. These changes are not due to changes in hemoglobin concentration and will be more irregular than system noise. Section 5.3.2 discusses several algorithms for identifying and removing data contaminated by optode movement or loss of good optode-skin coupling. .

In Figure 6, see the positive correlation between adipose tissue thickness and DPF where ATT reanges from 1.9 to 8 millimeters. This positive correlations can be observed at all wavelengths and interfiber distances. The maginitude of the variation in DPF depends on the thickness of the first layer encountered by the photons, in the case of NIRS measurements on humans, the adipose tissue. For larger ATT, the influence on DPF increases. .

Horschig. “Signal Quality Index: An Algorithm for Quantitative Assessment of Near Infrared Spectroscopy Signal Quality.” Biomedical Optics Express 11, no. 11 (2020): 6732–54. https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.409317 Defined the SQI as a numeric scale from 1 (very low quality) to 5 ( very high qulity) to quantitatively assess fNIRS signal quality. The SQI uses the optical densitites (OD) and hemoglobin measurements (O2Hb and HHb). Data must be preprocessed by first detrending the the signal segments by subtracting the least squares fit of a straight line to the data. Then, the signals were band-pass filtered using a zero-phase forward Hamming-windowed sinc FIR fitler of order 208 with cutoff frequencies (-6dB) of 0.4 Hz and 3Hz.Stage 1 of rating involved identifying very low quality signals. First, OD should fall within the range of 0.04 OD and 2.5 OD to be considered good quality. If the signal segment exceeds those thresholds, it is not considered a good quality signal. Second, the standard devation of the ODs per wavelength should be greater than 0. If the standard deviation of the ODs per wavelength is 0, then there was probably poor scalp coupling and can be labelled a very low quality signal. Third, the sum of the absolute values of the O2Hb signals should be greater than the sum of the absolute values of the HHb signals. The threshold of the ratio of sum O2Hb to sum HHb was derived from the training data set and set to be 1.95.Stage 2 of rating involved identifying very high quality signals. Very high quality signals have a similar amplitude and shape of the autocorrelation for the two optical densities of a signal segment, therefore the standard devation between them should be low. A threshold for the standard deviation of the difference between optical density signals autocorrelation was set to 0.025. If the value falls below 0.025 for the signal segment, that signal segment is considered a very high quality signal.Stage 3 of rating involved assigning a numerical value, 1-5, for the quality of the signal segment. The output of the logarithm of the ratio between the standard deviation of O2Hb and HHb was used to quantitatively rate the signal quality. High quality fNIRS signals show a strong heartbeat in O2Hb data and less strong of a heartbeat in HHb data, therefore the standard deviation of O2Hb should be greater than the standard deviation of HHb. .

The NIRS probe (NIRO-300) was places overlying the palpable liver and directly below the right costal arch, with an inter-optode distance of 40 mm and shielded from ambient light. The NIRO-300 uses SRS principles with 4 laser diodes to obtain absolute measures for TOI. NIRS were taken at a sample rate of 2 seconds for 15 minutes, at which time blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter and SvO_2 was measured oximetrically. TOI and SvO_2 were positively correlated (r = 0.72) with the strongest correlation between TOI and SvO_2 when the catherter tip was located in the right atrium and without intra-cardia left-to-right shunt or sepsis (n=23, r = 0.88). Multivariate regression revealed SvO_2 explained up to 51% of the observed variance in TOI, with the addition of variables age, hemoglobin concentration, SaO_2, FOE,Ca-vO_2, VCV tip position, positive pressure ventilation, sepsis, and intra-cardiac shunts only increasing the proportion of explained variance to 52.4%. TOI and SvO_2 are good mutual predictors however they appear to be independent variables. .
