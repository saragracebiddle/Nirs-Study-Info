Take a quick look through the list and eliminate any definitively ineligible patients. Sometimes metastatic disease is listed as a second diagnosis and therefore slips through the exclusion of metastatic disease. Vascular diseases and injuries that would preclude ability to exercise are other common exclusion criteria. Take a quick look through the patientâ€™s problem list. If the patient does not have any immediate exclusionary problems, pass their name and MRN on to the research coordinators, Sydney Hackwell and Katie Banenas. They will conduct a full chart screening and contact the patient if they are eligible. After contacting the patient, they will contact you if the patient signs the consent form. After the consent form is signed, we can begin contacting the patient to start scheduling for lab visits. If a patient is not wearing shorts for a lab visit, there are disposable shorts in the lab for patient use. They are located in a box under the bed in the back corner.
