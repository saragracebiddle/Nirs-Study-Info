\section{Near Infrared Spectrosopy}\label{Literature-nirs}}

Continuous wave NIRS devices use the modified Beer-Lambert law to calculate the volume of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.

Spatially resolved NIRS devices use multiple transmitters at different distances from a reciever to calculate a Tissue Saturation Index, or TSI.

The NIRS device utilized in this study is the PortaMon by Artinis Medical Systems. The PortaMon could be considered both a continuous wave and spatially resolved device. It uses three continuous-wave transmitters with a single receiver to calculate the TSI.

Each transmitter emits two wavelengths of infrared light. One wavelength is for oxygenated hemoglobin and one wavelength is for deoxygenated hemoglobin, therefore each transmitter measures both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin.

The transmitters emit light into tissue where the light waves bounce off structures in the tissue and return to the receiver.

The receiver measures the light that returns in Optical Densities. Calculations using several different parameters and assumptions convert OD into usable units.

Subcutaneous adipose tissue has different optical properties than muscle tissue. Most calculations do not account for two separate layers of tissue with different scattering and optical properties. There have been some papers within the last few years examining multi-layered tissues and the effects on NIRS measurements using computer modeling and phantom tissues. Most papers utilizing NIRS in exercise physiology assume a limited or negligible effect of adipose tissue thickness on measurements and report participants' adipose tissue thickness.

Different areas of the body have different types of tissue structure and this have different optical properties. Previous papers have reported the measurements of optical properties at various locations of the body. Consult with the device manufacturer and reports of these optical properties to determine the best settings for your device.

Most studies assume that the tissue structures have constant optical properties. This may not hold true, especially during activities like exercise where blood flow increases and the contents of blood fluctuate. Accounting for varying optical properties has led to the development of time-domain and other measurement techniques. These devices are more expensive than a continuous wave device. Therefore, most NIRS devices assume constant optical properties of the measured tissues.

The differential pathlength factor (dpf) is the measurement of the path that the light waves take through tissue. DPF values have been well researched and measured for multiple body locations and differing adipose tissue thicknesses. This parameter is used in calculating TSI.

\section{Screening the Electronic Medical Record}\label{screening-the-electronic-medical-record}}

Prisma Health uses EPIC as their electronic medical record service.
You can only access EPIC with permission from Prisma Health. The medical students may technically have access to EPIC but they have not had much training on how to use it and actually accessing it can be cumbersome and difficult for them. It is much easier for a Research Coordinator to do any work in EPIC.

Use the Production Environment of EPIC. In the Production Environment, you can create and run reports that you cannot in the Read Only Environment.

Log in with your Prisma Health log in information and select the department \texttt{CANCER-FARIS\ ONCOLOGY\ {[}100224000{]}}.

This will return a list of potentially eligible patients who meet the parameters specified in the query above. I have the report settings such that the results table shows me their treatment plan start date, next oncology appointment date, name, MRN, clinical stage, diagnosis, and plan provider. When I select a patient from the list, it displays an Oncology Snapshot under the report results table. I take a quick look through the Oncolog Snapshot and if I need to take a closer look at their chart, I can open it up.

I have not figured out how to share this report or its results with other people. As it is, I look through the patients returned by the report and eliminate any definitively ineligible patients.

Sometimes metastatic disease is listed as a second diagnosis and therefore slips through the exclusion of metastatic disease. Vascular diseases and injuries that would preclude ability to exercise are other common exclusion criteria. Male patients with breast cancer are not eligible for this study. Take a quick look through the patient's problem list. If the patient does not have any immediate exclusionary problems, pass their name and MRN on to the research coordinators, Sydney Hackwell and Katie Banenas. They will conduct a full chart screening and contact the patient if they are eligible.

I include all patients returned by the report into the List. This is because, from day to day, the report returns different patients. If a patient is not in the List, I will assume that I have not yet looked at their chart. So, even if I look at a chart and immediately determine that a patient is not eligible, I write their information into the List and mark them ineligible so I don't forget that I already screened their chart. This also helps determine if there are new potentially eligible patients returned by the report. On average, the report will return between 5 and 10 patients. Due to the month long limit on treatment plan start date, the report will return the same patients for many days in a row. If you don't keep track of everyone that the report returned, even the ineligible ones, you may get confused about which patients need to be screened and which ones you have already screened.

\hypertarget{using-the-schedule}{%
\subsection{Using the Schedule}\label{using-the-schedule}}

Open the \texttt{Schedule} tab.

If there is not a schedule view that you like, you can make your own by clicking the green plus sign above \texttt{My\ Schedule}.

Give it a name. I called mine \texttt{nirs\ providers}. Under \texttt{Selected\ Columns} you can choose what information you want to display about the appointment. Under \texttt{Configuration}, you can add the providers. I added all five oncologists.

Now when you select that schedule, you will only see the five oncologists that refer to the NIRS study. To take a closer look at an appointment, expand the schedule by clicking the gray triangle next to the name of the schedule. Click on the provider name whose schedule you are interested in. This will expand the schedule of only that provider, where you can see more details about their appointments. Use the calendar in the top left to select different days.

Click on an appointment you are interested in examining further. This should open up a panel to the right of the schedule. I have this set up to show \texttt{Snapshot} as the default view. You can rearrange the panels shown in the snapshot by clicking on the wrench in the top right of the snapshot panel.

I use the schedule to screen patients coming in to the Multidisciplinary Clinic (MDC).

Jorgensen has appointments in the MDC every other Monday. Stephenson has appointments in the MDC every other Thursday. Screen these appointments at least one day before. Many will not have a chemotherapy plan or a cancer staging activity yet. Look for major health problems that would disqualify them from participation. If there are no major problems, pass the appointment information on to Katie and Sydney. If a patient has triple negative or estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative breast cancer, they are likely to receive chemotherapy and Katie or Sydney can contact them as soon as the chemotherapy is prescribed. This gives us more time for recruitment into the study, as Katie and Sydney can be at the MDC appointment or at the appointment where they are told about the chemotherapy, which is a lot more time than waiting until the chemo teach appointment to approach a patient.

\hypertarget{potential-patient-list}{%
\section{Potential Patient List}\label{potential-patient-list}}

I use a Microsoft List, created in my PrismaHealth OneDrive, to share the patient information with Katie and Syndey rather than sending tons of emails. I update the list when I identify potentially eligible patients. I include the patient's MRN, first and last name, primary diagnosis (breast or gynecological), and which of the referring oncologists is on their treatment team. If they have an upcoming appointment that Katie or Sydney could go to and tell them about the study, I include the appointment information. If their first chemotherapy infusion is scheduled, I include that date so that we know how long we have to recruit and schedule them in the HPL.

Katie and Sydney look through the list and conduct a more in depth chart screening. If they determine that a patient is not eligible, they click the \texttt{Ineligible} tag in the List and include reasons that the patient is not eligible. The categories of ineligibility that I included as defaults are: metastatic disease, chemotherapy treatment within the last five years, lab values, treatment plan other than chemotherapy. You can type in any new category you need; you are not limited to just the default ineligibility values.

If a patient is determined to be eligible, one of the Research Coordinators will contact their oncologist to get permission to approach the patient at their next appointment. If the provider declines the study for them, then the patient is marked as \texttt{Declined} in the List. If the provider consents for the patient to be approached about the study, then one of the Research Coordinators will approach the patient at their next appointment. The patient will then either sign a consent or decline the study. If they decline the study, click the \texttt{Declined} tag in the List. Include a reason that they declined, such as stress, not enough time, etc.

After contacting the patient, they will contact you if the patient signs the consent form. After the consent form is signed, we can begin contacting the patient to start scheduling for lab visits. Contact Dr.~Julie Martin after obtaining the consent form and she will put all NIRS related blood draws into EPIC. If for some reason we are not able to get the NIRS draws done at the same time as the other pre-chemo blood draws, consult with the patient and schedule this through Dr.~Julie Martin.

If a patient is not wearing shorts for a lab visit, there are disposable shorts in the lab for patient use. They are located in a box under the bed in the back corner.

\hypertarget{travel-expenses}{%
\section{Travel Expenses}\label{travel-expenses}}

If a patient lives more than 50 miles from the Cancer Institute, they are eligible for travel expenses to be reimbursed. Use a map service, such as Google Maps, to map the driving distance between their address and the Cancer Institute.

The Greenphire \href{https://www.clincard.com}{ClinCard} is a re-loadable debit card that we use for reimbursement purposes. Have the patient fill out a W-9 if they qualify for the ClinCard.

Sara Biddle has access to the ClinCard Admin Portal. If you need to get access to the ClinCard Admin Portal, contact Jan Keuber at the Clinical Research Management Office for help.

The ClinCard for the NIRS study is currently programmed for up to 10 visits to the lab. Each visit can reimburse up to \$125 for any travel or hotel expenses.

This protocol is the participant's first visit.

\hypertarget{Methods-LT-prep}{%
\subsection{Preparation}\label{Methods-LT-prep}}

At least 30 minutes prior to when the participant is scheduled to arrive, turn on the metabolic cart.

Print out the following instruments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  MMSE \ref{Appendix-Surveys-mmse}
\item
  Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire \ref{Appendix-Surveys-glteq}
\item
  Physical Activity History \ref{Appendix-Surveys-pah}
\item
  BFI \ref{Appendix-Surveys-bfi}
\item
  PROMIS Global Health \ref{Appendix-Surveys-promis}
\item
  Lactate Threshold Data Collection Sheet
\end{itemize}

Write the patient's study ID number, visit ID, and the date in the upper left corner of each in pen.

Assemble the VO\textsubscript{2} mask except for the blue rubber part as described in \ref{Parvo-MaskAssembly}.

Prepare the PortaMon as described in \ref{PortaMon-Preparation}.

Calibrate the metabolic cart as described in \ref{Parvo-Calibration}.

\hypertarget{Methods-LT-DataCollection}{%
\subsection{Data Collection}\label{Methods-LT-DataCollection}}

Use the steps described in \ref{Appendix-Instruments-Ultrasound-Usage} to measure the participant's subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness above their vastus lateralis.

After the patient arrives, the participant's subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness is measured using an ultrasound. If ATT is less than 2 centimeters, the participant continues through the next steps.

Place the NIRS device over the area measured using ultrasound following the steps described in \ref{PortaMon-Placement}.

Administer the following instruments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  MoCA \ref{Appendix-Surveys-moca}
\item
  MMSE \ref{Appendix-Surveys-mmse}
\item
  Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire \ref{Appendix-Surveys-glteq}
\end{itemize}

The MoCA, MMSE, and GLTEQ are exclusion criteria. If the participant does not pass these items, they cannot proceed with the study, therefore they are administered before other instruments. If the participant passes the exclusion instruments, proceed with the rest of the instruments. These instruments are not filled out by the participant- a study staff member must administer and score these instruments.

Have the subject complete the following instruments:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Physical Activity History \ref{Appendix-Surveys-pah}
\item
  BFI \ref{Appendix-Surveys-bfi}
\item
  PROMIS Global Health \ref{Appendix-Surveys-promis}
\end{itemize}

These instruments are completed by the participant.

Review the completed Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire and Physical Activity History instruments. Use your best judgement in collaboration with the other investigators to determine the wattage jumps. See \ref{ExerciseTesting-LT-Watts} for further information about deciding wattage jumps.

Measure the subject's face to determine mask size. Record mask size on data collection sheet. Finish assembling mask.

Put the heart rate monitor on the patient.

Have the subject get on the stationary bike and make adjustments to the seat height, seat depth, pedal length, and handlebar placement to the comfort of the participant.

\subsection{Using the App}\label{using-the-app}}

Use the exported \texttt{.txt} file. Upload this file into the Shiny app.

Refer to the data collection sheet and find the time on the NIRS that the exercise test started. Input this time.

Look at the graph of the data. Make sure that the transitions are at the appropriate times on the graph. The graph should end on a rest stage. The transitions between stages should occur at the labelled vertical lines on the graph. If the graph seems a little off, you can adjust the start time by a few seconds to align the timing of the transitions as close as possible to the labelled lines on the graph.

Once the graph of the raw data looks correct, look at the plotted regressions. The gray is the raw data and the red is the regression line. The red should follow the gray raw data as closely as possible. If the regression does not seem to follow this at all, you can try adjusting the \texttt{transition\ time} variable. This will remove a few seconds from the beginning and end of the stage, where the patient may have been moving around on the bike or adjusting from the previous stage. Check to make sure that removing the time made a beneficial difference. Sometimes removing the transition time is helpful and sometimes it makes things worse so try several values and check the regression lines each time.

Once you are content with the regressions, check the final table of regression coefficients.

When you are okay with the results obtained from the app, you can download the report as a \texttt{.pdf}. The report shows the parameters used for the analysis, graphs, and results tables from the analysis. Save this \texttt{.pdf} with the raw \texttt{.txt} file and name is appropriately.

\hypertarget{by-hand}{%
\subsection{By Hand}\label{by-hand}}

Use the exported \texttt{.txt} file.

Read in the exported PortaMon data.

I have written a custom file reader for exported PortaMon files. Oxysoft allows you to add in `Events' to the measurements, kind of like time markers. However, when you export the measurements after adding an `Event', Oxysoft adds an extra column that is mostly empty except for where the `Event' was added in. Most read functions do not like this and will throw an error when you try to read in the data. The function I wrote will take the file and throw out the extra `Event' column. Oxysoft also adds metadata to the header of the file. Most read in functions do not like this either, as they will look to the top of the file to figure out what the rest of the file looks like. \texttt{read\_nirs} will parse the metadata for the information we would like to keep. Then it reads the actual data as a data frame. The useful metadata pieces are passed on to the user as attributes of the raw data frame.

The PortaMon does not record in increments of time, it records the sample number. The PortaMon records data at a rate of 10 hz, so it takes 10 samples a second. The time in seconds from the start of the test is the sample number divided by 10.

The PortaMon was on and collecting data from the time the device was placed until the end of the exercise test. We aren't interested in the data from before the start of the exercise test, so that can be removed. The best way to do this is to create a new column, named something like \texttt{zeroed\_time} or \texttt{time\_aligned}, and calculate it such that time = 0 in the \texttt{zeroed\_time} column is the start time of the test. Everything before that is a negative time and everything after is positive. Then you can filter on \texttt{zeroed\_time\ \textgreater{}\ 0}. Why not just filter on \texttt{time\ \textgreater{}\ start\_time}? If the start time written on the data collection sheet was off by a few seconds (which it often is), you cannot go back and readjust it, especially not if the time needs to be adjusted backwards. You can easily re-calculate the \texttt{zeroed\_time} column based on the original time column, using the same data frame.

And you don't have to remember the start times of every data frame. If every data frame has been read in and time adjusted, then every data frame just needs to be filtered on \texttt{zeroed\_time\ \textgreater{}\ 0}.

Plot the raw data to be sure that you removed all extraneous data from the beginning of the data frame. Make adjustments to the start time as needed.

Next, find the time chunks for each section of the test. An on/off kinetics consists of the following sections, each 2 minutes (120 seconds) in duration: Baseline Rest, Warm Up, Work 1, Rest 1, Work 2, Rest 2, Work 3, and Rest 3.

Plot the exercise test. On the x axis, use time in seconds. Have dual y axes, one with hemoglobin arbitrary units and one with percentages. Plot all signals (O\textsubscript{2}Hb and HHb for all exported transmitters and TSI) over time and check that the transitions between sections line up with the expected times. Adjust slightly as necessary, as the start time recorded for the test may be silghtly off due to human error / time taken for the PARVO to begin the test.

Use the plot and notes from the test to examine the data for movement artifacts that need to be removed before analysis. Remove as necessary.

The oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin measurements have arbitrary units- they are change in oxy and deoxyhemoglobin. This means that we cannot use the amounts of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and compare those over time. For example, the average oxyhemoglobin at rest could be measured as 4 for one test and 6 at the next test. This does not mean that at the second test, the amount of oxyhemoglobin in the blood was actually higher than at the first test.

Average the O\textsubscript{2}Hb and HHb across the transmitters.

Calculate the steady state at the end of each non-baseline and non-warm up section (6 sections in total- 3 work sections and 3 rest sections) by averaging the last 30 seconds of the section for each signal type (O\textsubscript{2}Hb, HHb, and TSI).

There are 18 steady state values: 3 signal types and 6 sections.

Calculate the delta steady state for each transition.
Subtract the rest steady state from the corresponding work steady state. I.e. subtract rest 1 steady state from work 1 steady state.

There are 9 delta steady state values: 3 signal types and 3 transitions.

We use the following equation to describe an asymptotic or monoexponential curve:

\[y =({Asym}-B_0) - ({Asym}-B_0)*e^{-t/ \tau} \]

Where \({Asym}\) is the asymptote (or Steady State), \(B_0\) is the value at time 0, \(t\) is the time (in seconds), and \(\tau\) is the time constant.

Calculate the coefficients for the monoexponential curve for each transition. There are 9 monoexponential curve equations: 3 signal types and 3 transitions.

When you are satisfied with the results obtained from the app, download the report and upload it into the RedCap.

\section{Specifications}\label{PortaMon-Specs}}

The \href{https://www.artinis.com/portamon}{PortaMon} by Artinis Medical Systems is a spatial-resolved near-infrared resonance spectroscopy device. It uses one receiver with three infrared transmitters. Each transmitter is 5 millimeters further from the receiver. This allows the application of mathematical formulas to calculate an absolute tissue hemoglobin saturation, which Artinis Medical Systems refers to as the Tissue Saturation Index, or TSI. In the literature, this is referred to by various acronyms, such as TOI (Tissue Oxygenation Index). A full examination of the mathematics and physics behind the calculation of TSI was published as part of the SPIE Conference on Optical Tomography and Spectroscopy of Tissue III in 1999 \citep{Suzuki1999TissueOM}.

\hypertarget{Oxysoft}{%
\section{Oysoft}\label{Oxysoft}}

Oxysoft is the software created by Artinis Medical Systems to connect with the PortaMon, collect, and analyze data.

Oxysoft is installed on the ASUS laptops that go with the yellow cases. These laptops do not have any PrismaHealth or USC SoMG software on them. If someone should want to install Oxysoft on a PrismaHealth or USC SoMG computer, Oxysoft will have to be approved by the respective organization's IT team.

Oxysoft has been approved to be on Sara Biddle's PrismaHealth desktop computer by PrismaHealth's IT. No other PrismaHealth or USC SoMG computers have Oxysoft installed.

If you wish to install Oxysoft on a personal computer or have been approved to install Oxysoft on an organization's computer, plug the yellow Artinis Oxysoft USB into the computer and run the installer.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Oxysoft uses a legacy Bluetooth dongle to connect to the PortaMon. This makes using Oxysoft on a computer with the most up to date Windows difficult. It is easier to collect data on the ASUS laptops, which are default configured to use the Bluetooth dongle, and then export the data for analysis.
\item
  Oxysoft creates files with the extension \texttt{.oxy4} for every new measurement.

The PortaMon batteries can hold up to 8 hours of power for the device. Make sure they are fully charged prior to a patient's visit.

Plug the micro-USB into the battery charging dock. Plug this into an outlet. Place the battery into the dock, sticker side down. The three metal connectors on the narrow side of the battery must be touching the three metal connectors on the charging dock. If the battery is correctly placed in the dock, an LED will light up. When the battery is fully charged, the LED will be green.

\hypertarget{PortaMon-Placement}{%
\subsection{Instrument Placement on Vastus Lateralis}\label{PortaMon-Placement}}

The PortaMon can measure up to 2 centimeters depth into tissue. Since we are interested in muscle oxygenation, the muscle belly has to be within 2 centimeters from the surface of the skin. Otherwise, the device is not measuring muscle oxygenation but adipose tissue oxygenation. Therefore, we use an ultrasound to measure the subcutaneous adipose tissue thickness.

Place the device over the location measured by ultrasound.

Connect the NIRS by following the steps under \ref{PortaMon-StartMeasurement}.

Click `yes' to enable light sources and begin data collection. Wait approximately 10 seconds. Check the DAQ (Data Acquisition) values to determine whether the NIRS is receiving good data. If one or more of the DAQ values show as red, then make small adjustments to the placement of the device to attempt to get better DAQ values. If the small adjustments add up to a large difference from the original ultrasound measurement location, re-measure adipose tissue thickness using the ultrasound in the new location.

When all three DAQ values remain white when the subject moves around their leg, then the device is in the best location. If one of the DAQ values turns red during movement, that can be okay but only ONE. If two of the DAQ values are red, then TSI cannot be calculated so we do our best to have at least two good signals, three if at all possible.

Rock the device laterally and remove the tape cover on the exposed side. Rock the device back into place and stick the tape to the subject's skin. Repeat on the other side. Double check that the DAQ values remain consistent.

Take a picture of the placement. Use a measuring tape to show the distance from the top of the kneecap to the bottom of the device and use a perpendicular measuring tape to show the distance from the center of the thigh to the right edge of the device. Print the picture and place in the participant's physical file. Upload a .png of the picture into the RedCap.

The \href{http://www.parvo.com/}{TrueOne} Metabolic Cart by ParvoMedics measures maximal O2 consumption, indirect calorimetry, and other metabolic conditions.

The computer that has the ParvoMedics software installed is not connected to the internet in any way. It has Windows 7. \textbf{Never connect this computer to the internet or update Windows.} This would require attaining approval to install the ParvoMedics software on PrismaHealth computers, which would take several months. The ParvoMedics software is not frequently updated and Windows updates could break the installation. Everything works as it is, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

\subsection{Calibration}\label{Parvo-Calibration}}

In order to conduct calibration, the cart must have been powered on for \emph{at least 30 minutes}.
Turn on the cart by flipping the switch on the power strip on the back of the cart.

Log in using the password taped to the cart under the keyboard.

The computer on the cart is not connected to the internet. After logging in, you need to manually set the date and time to today's date and time. If you do not manually set the date and time, the data collection software will use the incorrect date and time and will save the data as such, which will make it difficult to locate later.

Open the ParvoMedics software.

Ensure the filter and other pieces are connected to the gas analyzer as shown below:

\subsubsection{Flowmeter Calibration}\label{ParvoCalibration-Flowmeter}}

Select `Flowmeter Calibration' from the software home page.

Enter room temperature (Celcius), barometric pressure (mmHg), and room humidity (\%) from the Davis Vantage Vue on Sara Biddle's desk.

Get a piece of long clear tubing from Parvo equipment cabinet behind the door. The calibration syringe and connection piece are located in the third shelf on the Parvo cart.

Connect one end of the tubing to the clear end of the connection piece.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/parvocalibration/connector_piece}

Connect the other end of the tubing into the gas analyzer module.

Connect the white end of the connection piece to the mouth of the calibration syringe.

\hypertarget{Parvo-Calibration-Gas}{%
\subsubsection{Gas Calibration}\label{Parvo-Calibration-Gas}}

Select `Gas Calibration' from the software home screen.

Enter room temperature (Celcius), barometric pressure (mmHg), and room humidity (\%) from the Davis Vantage Vue on Sara Biddle's desk.

Click `OK'.

When prompted, find the sample gas (gas container on the bottom left of the cart) and rotate the black handle on top of the gas container counter-clockwise until you cannot turn it anymore. Do not turn the black knob that is taped in place.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/parvocalibration/gas_on}

Click `OK' and wait for the next prompt on the screen.

Rotate the black handle on top of the gas container clockwise as far as you can to the ``OFF'' position.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/parvocalibration/gas_off}

Click `OK' to see calibration results.

DO NOT SAVE results if the percentage is greater than 1\%. This means that this calibration differs from the last calibration by more than we want. If you save the results, since it is a percentage change from the last calibration, the next calibration will have to decrease by greater than 1\%.

Example: First calibration attempt results in a percentage of 1.5\%. In order to be within 1\% of the attempt prior to the first attempt, the second calibration attempt will need to result in a percentage of -0.5\%.

To save us from doing this math in between calibration attempts, just do not save attempts greater than 1\% difference.

If results are greater than 1\%, try the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  open the lab door
\item
  turn on the fans to blow air around the room
\item
  wait at least 10 minutes and attempt calibration again
\end{itemize}

When the gas calibration results in less than 1\% change from the previous calibration, save results and exit to the home screen.

If you have tried all of the steps above and the gas calibration still results in greater than 1\% change from the previous calibration and you are out of time, save the gas calibration results. After the participant leaves, you can try to redo the gas calibration to get back under the 1\% change from the previous calibration. There are several reasons that the calibration will still result in a difference greater than 1\%, such as the weather, issues with the air conditioning, and more. The only things we can do to prevent issues with the calibration is limit the number of people in the lab. Have extra people stand out in the hallway or try to schedule fewer people to come in to the lab.

  \item
    Rotate the hard white plastic circle to make sure that the outer rim of the silicone cap is pulled over the lip all the way around.
  \item
    You should be able to gently push through the middle of the hard white plastic circle and stretch the top of the silicone cap out from the edge of the hard white plastic circle while the outer rim of the silicone cap stays in place over the lip of the hard white plastic circle.

    The arrows etched into the piece show the direction of air flow through the pieces. The air comes ``in'' from one opening, into and out of the mask where someone is breathing in and out of one opening, and ``out'' of one opening into the tubing and finally into the gas analyzer. The silicone pieces allow air to flow in only one direction so that all air the person breathes out is sent into the gas analyzer.
  \end{itemize}

  Orient the blue mask as if you were going to wear it on your face. The ``nose'' should be upward with the ``chin'' downward and the hard clear plastic pieces should face outward. You should only see blue rubber.
\item
  Orient the assembled pieces so that the air flows in the appropriate direction.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The ``out'' arrow direction with the clear tapered end should point towards the station with the gas analyzer, i.e.~if the gas analyzer will be on the left then the clear tapered end should point to the left, and if the gas analyzer will be on the right then the clear tapered end should point to the right. In the HPL, the stationary exercise bike will always have the gas analyzer on the left, therefore have the clear tapered end point to the left.
  \item
    The third opening with the semi-transparent circular piece should face the ``mouth'' of the blue rubber mask.

All men leave the room (except family the patient may or may not have brought with them to the lab). Spray water on the part of the monitor that will be in contact with the skin. Have the patient hold the center `button' on the strap to their sternum. Clip the ends of the strap together. Tighten the strap to be snug around the patient's chest. Push the strap up under the patient's bra strap and make sure the monitor is in contact with the skin all the way across the chest.

Use the watch to check that the monitor is sending a good signal. Press the middle button to the left of the watch face and wait to see the watch display a heart rate. If the heart rate does not display or shows a number that seems off, try to adjust the monitor to get a better connection. Try to push the monitor up higher on the sternum. This can be difficult on some patients depending on breast tissue, so do your best. Check the signal again.

\subsection{Cleaning Equipment}\label{Parvo-CleanEquipment}}

Put on a pair of gloves.

Everything that has touched the patient's skin will need to be cleaned. Place everything that needs to be cleaned into a pink bucket. This includes the mask, the mask straps, the clear tubing, the spit catcher, and the heart rate monitor strap.

Take apart the mask into its individual pieces. Take the button off the heart rate monitor strap and wipe the button down with an alcohol wipe.

On the blue cart in the corner behind the door, there is a white bucket with a lid. Take this cart with the pink bucket. When you walk through the hallways of the hospital, you can NOT wear gloves. Take off your gloves and put a clean pair in a pocket to bring with you just in case. Take the cart with the pink bucket of dirty equipment and walk to the service room. In the service room, take the pieces of the mask, disassembled, and the mask strap and the heart rate monitor strap and place them all in the blue liquid in the white bucket. Ensure the blue liquid covers all the pieces. Start a timer for 12 minutes. Leave everything soaking for 12 minutes. Make sure to put the lid on the bucket while it soaks, as the blue liquid is light sensitive.

While everything is soaking, pump soap and water into the clear tubing. Swish the soapy water around the tubing, making sure to get every part of the tubing. Do this over the sink or you will spill water out of the ends of the tubing. Rinse the tubing out and get out all of the soapy water. Use soap and water to clean out the bottom of the pink bucket. It had dirty equipment in it and it needs to be cleaned before you put clean equipment back in it.

At the end of the 12 minutes, pull all the parts out of the blue liquid and rinse them off in the sink. Put them in the pink bucket. Close the bucket of blue liquid. Walk the blue cart back to the lab. Take all the equipment and set it out to dry behind the door.

Turn on the ultrasound by pressing the power button in the top left of the keyboard.

Locate the vastus lateralis. Find the ASIS (anterior superior iliac spine) by asking the participant to place their hands on their hips and feeling for the bony protrusion at the front of the hip. Measure from the top of the kneecap to the ASIS. Locate the vastus lateralis by moving superior to the kneecap on-third of the distance from the kneecap to the ASIS.

Use the ultrasound gel to cover the wand.

Place the wand over the pre-determined location of the vastus lateralis. Move around the wand until you find the location of the thinnest section of adipose tissue. Ensure that this is still over the vastus lateralis by marking the location with a marker, then removing the wand and asking the patient to extend their leg and flex their quadriceps muscles. If the dot is not on top of the vastus lateralis when the patient extends their leg, try again. If the dot is over the vastus lateralis, place the wand back over the dot.

Freeze the screen.

Press the `caliper' button to use calipers on the frozen screen.

Move one end of the caliper to the top of the screen. Move the other end of the caliper to the area of the screen that looks like the boundary between the muscle belly and the edge of the adipose tissue. This will be a silvery line across the screen. Try to make the caliper measurement as vertical as possible, as a diagonal measurement will be larger than a straight one.

Turn on the lactate meter by pressing the center triangle-shaped button. Use the button to click through the screens until you reach the control screen. which has a star in the upper left corner and says `CRL-1'.

Put a lactate strip in the lactate meter. The white end should stick out from the meter and the metal end should go in the meter.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/lactatequalitycontrol/lactate_meters_ready}

Use the red control dropper to place a drop on the lactate strip. Wait for the lactate meter to give results (about 15 seconds). Record the results in the binder. Discard the used lactate strip in the trash and do another test with the red control with a new lactate strip.

If you get an error, you probably did not use enough liquid. Make sure the drops are of a size to completely soak the tip of the lactate strip.

Repeat with the blue control dropper.

\chapter{Exercise Testing}\label{ExerciseTesting}}

There are two types of exercise tests.

The lactate threshold test is conducted to determine what power output (wattage) is associated with a rise in lactate production. For the general population, lactate threshold is considered to be 4.0 mMoL/L.

The On/Off Kinetics test is conducted to measure the patient's mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The transition from work to rest allows the NIRS device to capture the magnitude and rate of oxygen recovery after exercise. The power output of the exercise is 110\% of the power output at lactate threshold. We use this power output in order to ensure that the exercise is difficult enough to produce a change in oxygen levels during exercise.
\#\# Administering Exercise Testing \{\#AdministerExerciseTest\}

We split up the work of administering the exercise test into three jobs:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{RPE}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For lactate threshold testing, the person doing RPE is the person taking the lactate measurements.
  \item
    For On/Off Kinetics testing, the person in charge of RPE tends to be the person who is in contact with the patient the most.
  \item
    With thirty seconds left in every stage of testing (both lactate threshold testing and on/off kinetics testing), they will hold up the clipboard with the RPE scale and say the following: \emph{``What is the first number that comes to mind?''}. \textbf{Say those exact words.} The patient will then say or point to the number that corresponds to how they are feeling.
  \item
    This person is also in charge of watching the patient on the bike and checking in to see how they feel. If the exercise becomes too difficult or the patient does not feel well, they are in charge of communicating with the rest of the team to end the test early and get the patient off the bike.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{NIRS}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Watch the NIRS computer as it is collecting data. Take note of any times when the signal from the NIRS is corrupted or when the patient is moving around during a rest. Record the time on the NIRS computer and note what was going on, i.e.~if the DAQ for Tx3 was red or if the patient was moving.
  \item
    During the on/off kinetics test, this person also helps the patient put their foot on the box. The NIRS device is always placed on the right leg, so the left leg of the patient goes on the box. The left leg needs to go on the box during a rest section to help the patient stay perfectly still. If both feet are left in the stirrups of the bike, the patient will tend to rock their feet back and forth to stay balanced on the bike. This causes movement in the NIRS data that we do not want. We choose to put the left leg on the box rather than the right leg because if the right leg is placed on the box like that, then the patient will be tensing their right quadriceps muscles. This would mean that we are not getting a true rest measurement of the vastus lateralis. Therefore, we put the left foot on a box and allow the right leg to dangle at complete rest in the stirrups of the bike. With fifteen seconds left in a work section before a rest, kneel down by the box and get ready. The Parvo person will give you a countdown to the end of the stage and when it hits 0 and the patient stops pedaling, pull their left foot out of the stirrup and place their heel on the box. Remind the patient to stay completely still. During a rest period, they are more likely to want to talk to fill the silence and if you make them laugh too hard, the NIRS data will be effected. Try to keep them still and focused on the resting. This is especially true for the last rest section, as they are done with the exercise which is the ``hard part''.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{PARVO}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Check during the initial rest on the bike that the Parvo is collecting valid data. At rest, VO2 should be between 3-5. If VO2 is lower than 3, check that the mask is forming a good seal around the patient's face. If the seal is good and the VO2 is still below 3, ask the patient to sit up straight and take normal breaths. Some people hunch over on the bike which decreases the volume of air that they breath in and out. Some people hold their breath a little bit when you put the mask on because it can feel a little claustrophobic. Remind them that the mask is not limiting their breathing, it is just measuring what they are breathing. Tell them that the system we use is the same one they use at NASA and the Olympic Training Centers. This tends to help people feel better.
  \item
    The Parvo shows the RPM of the bike. If the RPM drops below 60, encourage the patient to get the RPM back up above 60. If the RPM are higher than 110, remind the patient that they do not need to work that hard and try to drop the RPM below 90.
  \item
    For each stage, record the VO\_2\_, Heart Rate (bpm), and RPE. For a lactate threshold test, record the lactate measurements when the person taking the lactates yells them out. The VO2 and Heart Rate will be on the Parvo screen. There is a real time heart rate number and a fifteen second average number. The real time number is smaller and will be blinking in time with the heart rate. The fifteen second average number will be in one of the blue boxes in the top left. The fifteen second average numbers refresh every fifteen seconds. If the stage is three minutes long, you will wait until two minutes and fourty five seconds of the stage have passed and the final refresh has happened for that stage to record the VO2 and heart rate.
  \item
    For each stage, tell the patient when a stage is starting, when they are halfway done with the stage, when there is 30 seconds left in a stage, and give a countdown to the next stage. This would result in the following statements during one stage: ``The stage has begun. You are halfway done with this stage. Thirty seconds left in this stage. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One.'' If this is a lactate threshold test, you can make a comment about how this next stage should be slightly more difficult or how they should feel a change in the wattage. If this is an on/off kinetics test, they can tell the patient what the next stage will be, i.e.~work or rest. During a work stage, this could sound something like: ``Two minutes of exercise starting now. You're halfway to a rest. Thirty seconds left until rest.'' All of these statements also help the other staff to do their jobs. The thirty second mark tells the RPE person to get an RPE measurement and the countdown allows the NIRS person to get ready to do the box.
    There are two places to look for the time on the Parvo. There is a total elapsed time and there is a time left in this stage. The time left in the stage is the easiest to look at for keeping track of timing.

\section{Lactate Threshold Exercise Test}\label{ExerciseTesting-LT}}

\hypertarget{ExerciseTesting-LT-Specs}{%
\subsection{Specifications}\label{ExerciseTesting-LT-Specs}}

The lactate threshold test is completed on a cycle ergometer.

Ventilatory measurements are collected breath by breath via metabolic cart.
Lactate is measured via finger prick.

Prior to beginning exercise testing, measure resting blood lactate. This should be less than 2.0 mmoL/L in order to begin testing. Normal resting blood lactate lies between 0.8-1.2 mmoL/L, however stress or nervousness prior to an exercise test can increase resting blood lactate levels. If lactate levels are slightly elevated but still lower than 2.0 mmol/L, then lactate may drop back down as the body uses lactate during warm up stages.

The exercise test is conducted as follows:

Begin with a two minute rest. The subject sits on the stationary bike without pedaling for two minutes.
Each subsequent stage is three minutes in duration. The wattage increases by a consistent amount between each stage. During the last 30 seconds of each stage, blood lactate is measured via finger prick. Each lactate measurement is taken in pairs for duplicability.

Lactate will increase as exercise difficulty increases. When the subject's blood lactate exceeds 4.0 mmol/L, have the subject finish the next stage and then end the test. If the subject feels they cannot complete the next stage, end the test immediately. A blood lactate of 4.0 mmol/L should roughly correspond to a moderately difficult exercise intensity but should not be a maximal effort.

\hypertarget{ExerciseTesting-LT-Watts}{%
\subsection{Selecting Wattage Jumps}\label{ExerciseTesting-LT-Watts}}

Discuss the subject's physical activity levels. If the subject doesn't participate in much cardiorespiratory fitness activities, then start at a very low wattage (10 Watts) and make modest jumps (15 Watts). If the subject participates in long distance running, cycling, or swimming, then the subject may start at a higher wattage than less fit subjects and/or make larger jumps.

When selecting wattage jumps, remember that lactate should increase exponentially as wattage increases linearly. Also, when conducting testing, there is no second chance to get the testing correct. It is better to use a very low starting wattage with modest increases as the initial settings, because if the subject is fitter than expected and their blood lactate levels remain stagnant, the wattage jumps can be increased during testing. Blood lactate will not go down in the time it takes to conduct the testing, and if the difficulty increases too quickly then the blood lactate levels will increase so quickly that it will be difficult to analyze the lactate curve.

\section{On/Off Kinetics Exercise Test}\label{ExerciseTesting-Onoff}}

\hypertarget{ExerciseTesting-Onoff-Specs}{%
\subsection{Specifications}\label{ExerciseTesting-Onoff-Specs}}

The on/off kinetics test is completed on a cycle ergometer.

Ventilatory measurements are collected breath by breath via metabolic cart (ParvoMedics OneTrue 2400, \ref{Parvo}). Muscle oxygenation measurements are collected via SR-NIRS (Artinis Medical Systems PortaMon, \ref{PortaMon})

The exercise test consists of three square-wave transitions from exercise at 110\% of wattage at lactate threshold to rest. Each stage of the test is two minutes long.

\hypertarget{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-ExperimentalDesign}{%
\subsection{Experimental Design}\label{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-ExperimentalDesign}}

We will use an observational, 2-way, treatment x time, within-subjects research design to compare skeletal muscle oxidative capacity of the vastus lateralis muscle, during stationary cycling, across breast cancer or gynecological cancer patients at baseline and across their chemotherapy regimen. Muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity of the Vastus Lateralis muscle will be non-invasively evaluated using continuous wave, Near Infrared Resonance Spectroscopy (NIRS, PortaMon by Artinis Medical Systems BV in The Netherlands).

\hypertarget{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol}{%
\subsection{Study protocol}\label{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol}}

The NIRS participant testing will be performed in the University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville's Human Performance Laboratory located within Cancer Institute Faris Road facility. Testing will take approximately 30 minutes per session, with a maximum of 180 minutes of participation per patient. The independent variables in this study are drug regimen and number of chemotherapy treatments. The dependent variables in this study will be the change in oxygenation and deoxygenation status of the vastus lateralis as measured by the NIRS device, indicative of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, after a bout of cycling. Patients will be asked to avoid exercise and use of certain substances (tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, and contraindicated medications) 24 hours prior to testing.

The NIRS device consists of three LED transmitters that transmit light waves into muscle tissue and one high sensitivity PIN diode receiver, equipped with ambient light protection, which assesses light received from the transmitters. The three transmitters each emit light at two wavelengths. These wavelengths correspond to the absorption wavelengths of oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin in the skeletal muscle tissue (approximately 760 nm and 850 nm). These wavelengths of light will be received from three separate transmitter distances (30mm, 35mm, and 40mm) at 10 Hz. The ΔO2Hb and Δ tissue saturation index (TSI\%) will be calculated as the change from the last 30-s average of the work interval to the last 30-s average of the recovery interval. Oxygen uptake (VO2) will be obtained by using open-circuit spirometry (Parvo Medics, Inc, Salt Lake City, Utah). Cycling power will be determined via lactate threshold curves generated for each participant.
Participants will be asked to perform exercise in shorts or equivalent. Participants will first sit at rest in a chair, as the NIRS device is applied to the vastus lateralis. The device will have double sided adhesive tape to lightly secure its position to the skin. The device will be wrapped in a black cloth to fully secure its position, limit device mobility, and block ambient light in the laboratory. Participants will then stand and walk to the cycle with the NIRS secured to the participant's leg. Participants will sit on the bike for a 2-minute rest while wearing a fitted mask that comfortably measures the participant's rate and amount of oxygen uptake (VO2) and other ventilatory measurements at rest and during exercise.

\hypertarget{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol-Visit1}{%
\subsubsection{Visit 1}\label{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol-Visit1}}

Researchers will determine the participant's lactate threshold curve and ventilatory threshold during a graded exercise test (Table 1). The lactate threshold is a measure of the rate at which capillary blood lactate measurements rise as an effect of increased exercise intensity. The blood lactate curve will be used to determine an individualized power wattage for subsequent exercise testing of ``on-off kinetics'' (see below description). Capillary blood lactate levels will be obtained by finger stick for point of care testing. Ventilatory threshold will be measured using indirect calorimetry via a metabolic cart that captures expired gasses (O2 and CO2) through a comfortable silicone mask worn by the participant.

A baseline blood lactate level will be obtained at rest, then the participant will be instructed to cycle for three minutes beginning at 10W. After the 3-minute stage is complete, the power output will increase by 15 watts. The participant will cycle for 3 minutes at each stage until their lactate threshold reaches 4.0 mmol/L. Once the blood lactate reaches 4.0 mmol/L, one final, three-minute stage will be performed. A final lactate reading will be obtained at the completion of this exercise stage. The power output that is equivalent to 1.1x the wattage at which their lactate threshold exceeded 4.0 mmol/L will be used as the exercise intensity (``on-kinetics'') for subsequent visits accompanying chemotherapy treatments.

\hypertarget{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol-SubsequentVisits}{%
\subsubsection{Subsequent Visits}\label{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol-SubsequentVisits}}

Participants will return for each subsequent visit within a week before their next chemotherapy infusion as long as they are able to safely continue the exercise protocol (Table 2). The NIRS device will be secured to the participant's leg similar to the first visit and the participants will put on the mask to measure ventilation. Participants will begin pedaling for a warmup at 0 watts for 2 minutes. After the two-minute warm up period is completed, the power output will increase to the previously calculated wattage of 1.1x LT. The participant will cycle at a self-selected cadence at this power wattage for a duration of 2 minutes (``on-kinetics''). At the end of each on-kinetics stage, participants will be asked to rate their level of effort during exercise, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE). The participant will then stop pedaling and will remain in recovery, sitting on the bike for 2 minutes (``off-kinetics'' stage). With 5 seconds remaining in the ``off-kinetics'' stage, the participant will start pedaling at the same self-selected cadence for their next ``on-kinetics'' stage, followed by another 2-min ``off-kinetics'' period. This cycle of exercise followed by rest, known as on-off kinetics, will repeat for a total maximum of 3 times, or until the participant reaches volitional fatigue.

\hypertarget{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol-Surveys}{%
\subsubsection{Collection of Surveys and Biometrics at Each Visit}\label{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StudyProtocol-Surveys}}

We will be administering MoCA, BFI, Physical Activity Intake, PROMIS Global Health, and GLTPAQ surveys prior to participant engagement in cycling exercises. We will also be administering BFI, PROMIS Global Health, and Physical Activity Follow-up surveys after each individual study session to assess changes in cancer related fatigue associated with chemotherapy treatment that may develop throughout the study time period.

Patients will undergo routine, standard of care blood draws for a CBC and metabolic testing per their managing physician with an additional tube, during the same venipuncture, for a study covered aliquot for biomarkers related to mitochondrial health for correlative research.

For biomarker analysis, exosomes from patient serum (approximately 250 uL samples) will be isolated using an ExoQuick ULTRA EV Isolation System (System Biosciences). Exosomes will then be detected with Western blotting with exosome specific antibodies. Exosome samples will be sent for RNASeq analysis of RNA within the isolated exosomes at System Biosciences. Bioinformatics analysis of the RNAs identified from the RNASeq will then be used to determine if there are specific RNAs present in patient blood associated with changes in mitochondrial function. In addition, selected mRNAs associated with mitochondrial function will be assessed (expression levels determined) with RT-qPCR using aliquots of the isolated serum exosomes.

\hypertarget{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StatisticalAnalyses}{%
\subsection{Statistical Analyses}\label{Appendix-IRB-Protocol-StatisticalAnalyses}}

ANOVA one way with tukey post-hoc analysis to detect differences between drug regimen groups at each time point (baseline, all subsequent chemotherapy treatments) for time constant response and change in mitochondrial function for mitochondrial oxidative capacity. One-way ANOVAs will be used to additionally detect differences between different timepoints from baseline to final chemotherapy treatment for each individual chemotherapy regimen.
