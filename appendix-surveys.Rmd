## Brief Fatigue Inventory {#Appendix-Surveys-bfi}

The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) is a 9 item survey designed to assess fatigue severity in cancer patients [@mendoza1999]. Each item is measured on a 0-10 numeric scale. The final score is the mean of the 9 measure items and can range from 0-10. A score can be calculated if at least 5 items out of 9 are answered by taking the mean of the completed items. 

## Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire {#Appendix-Surveys-glteq}

Godin and Shephard made the `Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire` (LTEQ) in 1985 [@godinshepherd85]. The LTEQ was originally a two item survey: “Item 1 consists of 3 parts, in which participants note how often per week they do strenuous, moderate, and mild exercise. Item 2 asks participants to note how often they engage in an activity long enough to work up a sweat.“  This was used to group people into several different categories of activity levels. 
 
In 2011, Godin published the `Godin-Shephard Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire` (GLTPAQ) [@godinshepherd11]. This removed the second item and was used to group respondents into 2 categories, “insufficiently active” and “active” based on the ACSM guidelines for weekly moderate and strenuous physical activity levels. 
 
The form that we use says `Godin-Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire` across the top of the form, by the Oncology Nursing Society. At the bottom left, it says ‘adapted from: Godin, G. (2011). The Godin-Shephard leisure-time physical activity questionnaire. Health & Fitness Journal of Canada, 4(1), 18-22.’  I don’t know why that’s the title they chose to put on the top of the form, it’s made things more confusing than it needs to be. I have so far been unable to find the original paper that uses this form.
