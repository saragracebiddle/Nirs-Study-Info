  This study compares NIRS measured deoxyhemoglobin to VO2 as a predictor of endurance performance, as measured by time to completion. Deoxyhemoglobin was chosen for the NIRS variable because continuous-wave NIRS HHb is less influenced by factors such as skin blood flow, as asserted by Koga et al. 2015. NIRS derived measured were corrected for blood volume changes as described in Ryan, et al 2014.

   This research utilized the Portamon device to measure tissue oxygenation of the vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius in 13 male and 13 female participants using repeated, transient arterial occlusions after a brief exercise stimulus (knee extension or plantar flexion for VL and GC respectively). The NIRS measurements were taken twice, on separate days, for repeatability measurements. Participants also completed a step-incremental exercise test on a cycle ergometer to exhaustion to determine FAT_{max} and LT, and a ramp incrememental test on a cycle ergometer to detemine VO_{2max}, GET, and RCP. All gas exchange measures were normalized by LBM (lean body mass). Adipose tissue over the NIRS measurement site was measured via ultrasound. NIRS data were corrected for blood volume changes. TSI was not reported as the researchers used HHb for measures of muscle oxygenation kinetics, since HHb is independed of exercise intensity (according to [@ryan2013]). Female participants were an average of 24.7 $\pm$ 3.6 years old with adipose tissue thickness over the VL an average of 0.73 $\pm$ 0.22 cm. These participants had an average body mass of 58.7 $\pm$ 7.2 kg with lean body mass of 44.1 $\pm$ 5.2 kg, and VO_{2max} normalized for LBM of 54.9 $\pm$ 4.5 mL/kg LBM/min. NIRS derived skeletal muscle oxidative capacity for females in the vastus lateralis was 20.7 $\pm$ 4.4 seconds. Day-to-day reliability measures found a CV of $8.7\%$ and ICC of 0.793 for female vastus lateralis tau measurements.

    The effect of adipose tissue varies by muscle/placement site. To use linear regression of total Hb+Mb to correct for adipose tissue thickness, the following assumptions must be used: 1) total Hb+Mb is composed of muscle Mb and capillary Hb. 2) across subjects there is a common `true` value for resting total Hb+Mb. 3) Skin capillary density or thickness, sex, and training status have no effect 4) The relationship between adipose tissue thickness and total Hb+Mb is linear at all possible adipose tissue thicknesses. Myoglobin contributes between 60-90$\%$ to NIR signals and is thought to remain constant during exercise (See @davis13).

	    The data simulation approach can provide the researcher with useful knowledge about how changes in variables and different modeling and sampling techniques effect model results. This approach also allows the researcher to estimate power for complex models like a mixed effects model. You can also perform a sensitivity analysis, where power and sample size are held constant to determine the minimum effect size that would result in a significant result. You can also set effect size to zero and determine the rate of false positives from your model. R code is available on OSF.

	10 pediatric patients scheduled for cardiac catheterization were recruited for participation. The NIRS probe (INVOS 5100C) was place on the ninth right rib in the midaxillary line and a second NIRS was used to monitor cerebral oxygenation. Two blood samples were drawn from the heaptic vein and compared with the simultaneous measurement by NIRS. The directly measured hepatic vein saturation was not correlated with the NIRS measured saturation. This may be due to the fact that hepatic blood flow is not well understood and some areas of the liver may receive no portal venous input. Also, ultrasound was not used to measure the depth of the liver from the skin surface. Since the probe was placed directly over the rib, the bone may have affected the measurement of liver blood flow. The researchers may have benefitted from using the HomER algorithm to correct for bone. Also, the paper does not well elucidate which NIRS signal they use when they refer to rSO_2-H. The researchers chose a line graph with dual lines for portal vein saturation and NIRS measured saturation when a scatterplot demonstrating a lack of correlation would have been more appropriate. The researchers may have benefitted from using an ultrasound to determine the depth of the liver with respect to the NIRS probe in order to determine whether the signal truly reached the depth of the liver tissue.

  Extremely useful for finding sources on factors influencing fNIRS experimentation and solutions. This article breaks down factors into several categories : Environmental, Instrumentation, Mechanical, Population, Physiological, and Study Design/Data Analysis. Environmental factors include ambient light. Solutions include covering the optodes with something opaque. Optode calibration, an Instrumentation factor, can be conducted using algorithms, or for coninuous-wave systems, a simple normalization. This article recommends turning the LEDs on at least 30 minutes prior to data aquisition to allow for appropriate heating. Saturation effects and strategies to detect and remove them are discussed in section 4.4 on page 5. It is recommended to remove instrumental noise before using the Modified-Beer Lambert Law to convert optical densities into haemodynamic data. Abrupt movement may disturb optode-skin coupling which is shown in data as a large sudden change in chromophore concentration. These changes are not due to changes in hemoglobin concentration and will be more irregular than system noise. Section 5.3.2 discusses several algorithms for identifying and removing data contaminated by optode movement or loss of good optode-skin coupling.

  Differential pathlength factor (DPF) values are usually taken from literature and kept constant throughout the study. In Figure 6, see the positive correlation between adipose tissue thickness and DPF where ATT reanges from 1.9 to 8 millimeters. This positive correlations can be observed at all wavelengths and interfiber distances. The maginitude of the variation in DPF depends on the thickness of the first layer encountered by the photons, in the case of NIRS measurements on humans, the adipose tissue. For larger ATT, the influence on DPF increases.

  Defined the SQI as a numeric scale from 1 (very low quality) to 5 ( very high qulity) to quantitatively assess fNIRS signal quality. The SQI uses the optical densitites (OD) and hemoglobin measurements (O2Hb and HHb). Data must be preprocessed by first detrending the the signal segments by subtracting the least squares fit of a straight line to the data. Then, the signals were band-pass filtered using a zero-phase forward Hamming-windowed sinc FIR fitler of order 208 with cutoff frequencies (-6dB) of 0.4 Hz and 3Hz.

Stage 1 of rating involved identifying very low quality signals. First, OD should fall within the range of 0.04 OD and 2.5 OD to be considered good quality. If the signal segment exceeds those thresholds, it is not considered a good quality signal. Second, the standard devation of the ODs per wavelength should be greater than 0. If the standard deviation of the ODs per wavelength is 0, then there was probably poor scalp coupling and can be labelled a very low quality signal. Third, the sum of the absolute values of the O2Hb signals should be greater than the sum of the absolute values of the HHb signals. The threshold of the ratio of sum O2Hb to sum HHb was derived from the training data set and set to be 1.95.

Stage 2 of rating involved identifying very high quality signals. Very high quality signals have a similar amplitude and shape of the autocorrelation for the two optical densities of a signal segment, therefore the standard devation between them should be low. A threshold for the standard deviation of the difference between optical density signals autocorrelation was set to 0.025. If the value falls below 0.025 for the signal segment, that signal segment is considered a very high quality signal.

Stage 3 of rating involved assigning a numerical value, 1-5, for the quality of the signal segment. The output of the logarithm of the ratio between the standard deviation of O2Hb and HHb was used to quantitatively rate the signal quality. High quality fNIRS signals show a strong heartbeat in O2Hb data and less strong of a heartbeat in HHb data, therefore the standard deviation of O2Hb should be greater than the standard deviation of HHb.

	100 critically ill children up to the age of 8 with a central venous catheter were recruited to participate in the study. The NIRS probe (NIRO-300) was places overlying the palpable liver and directly below the right costal arch, with an inter-optode distance of 40 mm and shielded from ambient light. The NIRO-300 uses SRS principles with 4 laser diodes to obtain absolute measures for TOI. NIRS were taken at a sample rate of 2 seconds for 15 minutes, at which time blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter and SvO_2 was measured oximetrically. TOI and SvO_2 were positively correlated (r = 0.72) with the strongest correlation between TOI and SvO_2 when the catherter tip was located in the right atrium and without intra-cardia left-to-right shunt or sepsis (n=23, r = 0.88). Multivariate regression revealed SvO_2 explained up to 51\% of the observed variance in TOI, with the addition of variables age, hemoglobin concentration, SaO_2, FOE,Ca-vO_2, VCV tip position, positive pressure ventilation, sepsis, and intra-cardiac shunts only increasing the proportion of explained variance to 52.4\%. TOI and SvO_2 are good mutual predictors however they appear to be independent variables.
