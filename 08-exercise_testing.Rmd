## Lactate Threshold Exercise Test {#ExerciseTesting-LT}

### Specifications {#ExerciseTesting-LT-Specs}

The lactate threshold test is completed on a cycle ergometer. 

Ventilatory measurements are collected breath by breath via metabolic cart. 
Lactate is measured via finger prick.

Prior to beginning exercise testing, measure resting blood lactate. This should be less than 2.0 mmoL/L in order to begin testing. Normal resting blood lactate lies between 0.8-1.2 mmoL/L, however stress or nervousness prior to an exercise test can increase resting blood lactate levels. If lactate levels are slightly elevated but still lower than 2.0 mmol/L, then lactate may drop back down as the body uses lactate during warm up stages. 

The exercise test is conducted as follows:

Begin with a two minute rest. The subject sits on the stationary bike without pedaling for two minutes. 
Each subsequent stage is three minutes in duration. The wattage increases by a consistent amount between each stage. During the last 30 seconds of each stage, blood lactate is measured via finger prick. Each lactate measurement is taken in pairs for duplicability.

Lactate will increase as exercise difficulty increases. When the subject's blood lactate exceeds 4.0 mmol/L, have the subject finish the next stage and then end the test. If the subject feels they cannot complete the next stage, end the test immediately. A blood lactate of 4.0 mmol/L should roughly correspond to a moderately difficult exercise intensity but should not be a maximal effort. 

### Selecting Wattage Jumps {#ExerciseTesting-LT-Watts}

Discuss the subject's physical activity levels. If the subject doesn't participate in much cardiorespiratory fitness activities, then start at a very low wattage (10 Watts) and make modest jumps (15 Watts).  If the subject participates in long distance running, cycling, or swimming, then the subject may start at a higher wattage than less fit subjects and/or make larger jumps. 

When selecting wattage jumps, remember that lactate should increase exponentially as wattage increases linearly. Also, when conducting testing, there is no second chance to get the testing correct. It is better to use a very low starting wattage with modest increases as the initial settings, because if the subject is fitter than expected and their blood lactate levels remain stagnant, the wattage jumps can be increased during testing. Blood lactate will not go down in the time it takes to conduct the testing, and if the difficulty increases too quickly then the blood lactate levels will increase so quickly that it will be difficult to analyze the lactate curve. 

## On/Off Kinetics Exercise Test {#ExerciseTesting-Onoff}

### Specifications {#ExerciseTesting-Onoff-Specs}

The on/off kinetics test is completed on a cycle ergometer. 

Ventilatory measurements are collected breath by breath via metabolic cart (ParvoMedics OneTrue 2400, \@ref(Appendix-Instruments-Parvo)). Muscle oxygenation measurements are collected via SR-NIRS (Artinis Medical Systems PortaMon, \@ref(Appendix-Instruments-PortaMon))

The exercise test consists of three square-wave transitions from exercise at 110% of wattage measured via lactate threshold testing to rest.
