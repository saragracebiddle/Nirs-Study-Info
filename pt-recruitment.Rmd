# Patient Recruitment {#PatientRecruitment}

Run a report in EPIC with the following parameters:

> Select patients in registries
>
> FROM 
>
> *Registries:*
>
> Registry ID: CANCER POPULATION REGISTRY
>
> *Level of detail:*
>
> Patients
> 
> WHERE
>
> DM TREATMENT PLAN PROVIDER CONTAINS ELDER, JEFFERY WAYNE OR EDENFILED, WILLIAM JEFFERY OR JORGENSON, CARLA WALKER OR STEPHENSON JR, JOE JOHN OR PULS, LARRY EDWIN
>
> AND 
> 
> CHEMOTHERAPY IN LAST YEAR = NO
>
> AND DIAGNOSIS IN GROUPER BREAST OR GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER GROUPER
> 
> TREATMENT PLAN START DATE GREATER THAN TODAY - 14


This will return a list of potentially eligible patients who meet the parameters specified in the query above. Take a quick look through the list and eliminate any definitively ineligible patients. Sometimes metastatic disease is listed as a second diagnosis and therefore slips through the exclusion of metastatic disease. Vascular diseases and injuries that would preclude ability to exercise are other common exclusion criteria. Male patients with breast cancer are not eligible for this study.  Take a quick look through the patient's problem list. If the patient does not have any immediate exclusionary problems, pass their name and MRN on to the research coordinators, Sydney Hackwell and Katie Banenas. They will conduct a full chart screening and contact the patient if they are eligible.

After contacting the patient, they will contact you if the patient signs the consent form. After the consent form is signed, we can begin contacting the patient to start scheduling for lab visits. Contact Dr. Julie Martin after obtaining the consent form and she will put all NIRS related blood draws into EPIC. If for some reason we are not able to get the NIRS draws done at the same time as the other pre-chemo blood draws, consult with the patient and schedule this through Dr. Julie Martin. 

If a patient is not wearing shorts for a lab visit, there are disposable shorts in the lab for patient use. They are located in a box under the bed in the back corner.
