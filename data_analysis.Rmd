# Data Analysis {#DataAnalysis}

Be sure you have exported and stored all data appropriately. 

## Lactate Threshold {#DataAnalysis-LT}

Take the lactate threshold data collection sheet. 

Average the duplicate lactate measurements for each completed stage.

Make a plot of lactate by power (Watts). Find the power at which lactate would have been 4.00. That is the power at which lactate threshold occurred. 

Multiply this power by 1.1 to calculate the power at which the patient will conduct subsequent on/off kinetics testing.

## On/Off Kinetics {#DataAnalysis-Onoff}

### Using the App

Use the exported `.txt` file. Upload this file into the Shiny app. 

Refer to the data collection sheet and find the time on the NIRS that the exercise test started. Input this time. 

Look at the graph of the data. Make sure that the transitions are at the appropriate times on the graph. The graph should end on a rest stage. The transitions between stages should occur at the labelled vertical lines on the graph. If the graph seems a little off, you can adjust the start time by a few seconds to align the timing of the transitions as close as possible to the labelled lines on the graph. 

Once the graph of the raw data looks correct, look at the plotted regressions. The gray is the raw data and the red is the regression line. The red should follow the gray raw data as closely as possible. If the regression does not seem to follow this at all, you can try adjusting the `transition time` variable. This will remove a few seconds from the beginning and end of the stage, where the patient may have been moving around on the bike or adjusting from the previous stage. Check to make sure that removing the time made a beneficial difference. Sometimes removing the transition time is helpful and sometimes it makes things worse so try several values and check the regression lines each time. 

Once you are content with the regressions, check the final table of regression coefficients. 

When you are okay with the results obtained from the app, you can download the report as a `.pdf`. The report shows the parameters used for the analysis, graphs, and results tables from the analysis. Save this `.pdf` with the raw `.txt` file and name is appropriately.

### By Hand

Use the exported `.txt` file.

Read in the exported PortaMon data. 

The PortaMon does not record in increments of time, it records the sample number. The PortaMon records data at a rate of 10 hz, so it takes 10 samples a second. The time in seconds from the start of the test is the sample number divided by 10. 

The PortaMon was on and collecting data from the time the device was placed until the end of the exercise test. We aren't interested in the data from before the start of the exercise test, so that can be removed.

Next, find the time chunks for each section of the test. An on/off kinetics consists of the following sections, each 2 minutes (120 seconds) in duration: Baseline Rest, Warm Up, Work 1, Rest 1, Work 2, Rest 2, Work 3, and Rest 3. 

Plot the exercise test. On the x axis, use time in seconds. Have dual y axes, one with hemoglobin arbitrary units and one with percentages. Plot all signals (O_2Hb and HHb for all exported transmitters and TSI) over time and check that the transitions between sections line up with the expected times. Adjust slightly as necessary, as the start time recorded for the test may be silghtly off due to human error / time taken for the PARVO to begin the test. 

Use the plot and notes from the test to examine the data for movement artifacts that need to be removed before analysis. Remove as necessary.

The oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin measurements have arbitrary units- they are change in oxy and deoxyhemoglobin. This means that we cannot use the amounts of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin and compare those over time. For example, the average oxyhemoglobin at rest could be measured as 4 for one test and 6 at the next test. This does not mean that at the second test, the amount of oxyhemoglobin in the blood was actually higher than at the first test. 

Average the O_2Hb and HHb across the transmitters. 

Calculate the steady state at the end of each non-baseline and non-warm up section (6 sections in total- 3 work sections and 3 rest sections) by averaging the last 30 seconds of the section for each signal type (O_2Hb, HHb, and TSI). 

There are 18 steady state values: 3 signal types and 6 sections.

Calculate the delta steady state for each transition.
Subtract the rest steady state from the corresponding work steady state. I.e. subtract rest 1 steady state from work 1 steady state.

There are 9 delta steady state values: 3 signal types and 3 transitions.

We use the following equation to describe an asymptotic or monoexponential curve: 

\[y =({Asym}-B_0) - ({Asym}-B_0)*e^{-t/ \tau} \]

Where ${Asym}$ is the asymptote (or Steady State), $B_0$ is the value at time 0, $t$ is the time (in seconds), and $\tau$ is the time constant. 


Calculate the coefficients for the monoexponential curve for each transition. There are 9 monoexponential curve equations: 3 signal types and 3 transitions. 


When you are satisfied with the results obtained from the app, download the report and upload it into the RedCap.
