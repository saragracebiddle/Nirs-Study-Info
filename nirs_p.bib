  Differential pathlength factor (DPF) values are usually taken from literature and kept constant throughout the study. In Figure 6, see the positive correlation between adipose tissue thickness and DPF where ATT reanges from 1.9 to 8 millimeters. This positive correlations can be observed at all wavelengths and interfiber distances. The maginitude of the variation in DPF depends on the thickness of the first layer encountered by the photons, in the case of NIRS measurements on humans, the adipose tissue. For larger ATT, the influence on DPF increases.
