# Data Storage {#DataStorage}

Follow all appropriate data export instructions for PARVO and NIRS data.

All physical copies are stored in a locked filing cabinet in the Human Performance Lab.

The study [RedCap][RedCapURL] stores all identifying patient information and digital copies of data.

After a patient is identified and signs a consent form for the study, the research coordinator will fill out the `New Patient` survey in RedCap. When this survey is completed, it automatically assigns a study ID number to the patient and sends an email to Frankie Bennett and Sara Biddle about the newly consented participant. 

Use the information from the `New Patient` survey to pull up the patient's chart in EPIC. 

De-identified NIRS and VO~2~ data files can be stored on Prisma Health computers.
