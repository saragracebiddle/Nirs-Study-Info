# Data Storage {#DataStorage}

Follow all appropriate data export instructions for PARVO and NIRS data.

All physical copies are stored in a locked filing cabinet in the Human Performance Lab.

The study [RedCap][RedCapURL] stores all identifying patient information and digital copies of data.

After a patient is identified and signs a consent form for the study, the research coordinator will fill out the `New Patient` survey in RedCap. When this survey is completed, it automatically assigns a study ID number to the patient and sends an email to Frankie Bennett and Sara Biddle about the newly consented participant. 

When a patient completes an HPL visit, go to the patient's record in RedCap.

### Lactate Threshold Visit

Under the `Lactate Threshold` event in the appropriate patient record in RedCap, start filling out the data collection instruments for the event. 

Fill out the following data collection instruments: `HPL Visit`, `One-Time Measurements`, `Lactate Parvo`, `Godin Leisuretime Exercise Questionnaire`, `Mini-Mental State Examination`, `Brief Fatigue Inventory`, `PROMIS SF v1.1-Global Health`, `Physical Activity`, and `Data Files`. 

The information to fill out `HPL Visit`, `One-Time Measurements`, and `Lactate Parvo` will be found on the `Lactate Threshold Data Collection Sheet` that was filled out during the patient visit. 

De-identified NIRS and VO~2~ data files can be stored on Prisma Health computers.
